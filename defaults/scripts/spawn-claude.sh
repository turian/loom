#!/usr/bin/env bash
# spawn-claude.sh - Token-rotating launcher for Claude Code.
#
# This script is a thin layer that:
#   1. Selects a Claude Code OAuth token from .loom/tokens/ via the native
#      `loom-daemon tokens select` CLI (issue #4228, epic #4081 Phase 2 — the
#      historical interpreted-language selector call has been retired from
#      this path entirely; see loom-daemon/src/tokens_pool/select.rs).
#   2. Exports CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN.
#   3. exec's the underlying CLI (`claude` by default, or
#      `claude-wrapper.sh` if --use-wrapper is passed for retry behavior).
#
# It does NOT replace the existing 1700-LOC `.loom/scripts/claude-wrapper.sh`,
# which provides retry, backoff, auth-cache, and error classification.
# Use `claude-wrapper.sh` directly when you need that behavior; use this
# script when you want pure token rotation in front of either `claude` or
# the wrapper.
#
# Behavior on missing tokens:
#   Token selection resolves the effective pool (issue #3938): the per-repo
#   pool at `<repo>/.loom/tokens/` when it holds `*.token` files, else the
#   shared machine-level pool at `~/.loom/tokens/` (override
#   `LOOM_SHARED_TOKENS_DIR`; set it empty to disable the fallback). This lets a
#   consumer repo the daemon dispatches into — which has no pool of its own —
#   spawn against the shared pool instead of hard-failing. All pool STATE
#   (`.bad_tokens`/`.ranking`/`.allowlist`/`.failure_counts`) lives in whichever
#   pool was selected, so it is never forked per repo.
#   When NEITHER pool exists/has tokens (or all tokens are bad), this script
#   exits 78 (EX_CONFIG) with a message instructing the user to run
#   `loom-daemon tokens bootstrap` (or `--shared` for the machine-level pool).
#   It does NOT silently fall back to keychain.
#   (The recovery advice named the Python `loom-tokens` console script until epic
#   #4081 Phase 4, #4557, deleted the package that provided it; `loom-daemon
#   tokens` is the only implementation now.)
#
# Worktree handling:
#   When invoked from a git worktree, the script resolves the canonical repo
#   root via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` and looks up `.loom/tokens/`
#   there — never in the worktree's path.
#
# Env vars (pool location):
#   LOOM_SHARED_TOKENS_DIR  Shared machine-level pool location. Non-empty path
#                           overrides the `~/.loom/tokens` default; an empty
#                           value disables the shared fallback (per-repo only).
#
# Usage:
#   .loom/scripts/spawn-claude.sh -p "your prompt"
#   .loom/scripts/spawn-claude.sh --use-wrapper --prompt "..." --log /tmp/log
#
# Env vars:
#   LOOM_WORKSPACE         Override repo root detection.
#   LOOM_SPAWN_NO_EXPORT   If set, skip selection (caller already exported a
#                          token). Useful for testing the dispatch path.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN        Override the `loom-daemon` binary used for native
#                          token selection (see lib/locate-daemon-bin.sh for
#                          the full resolution order: this env var ->
#                          `loom-daemon` on PATH -> build-output-relative
#                          candidates under the repo).
#   LOOM_MODEL             Model to pass as `claude --model <value>` (issue
#                          #3477). Lowest-priority tier: an explicit `--model`
#                          in the passthrough args always wins. When neither
#                          is set, NO --model flag is emitted and the session/
#                          CLI default is preserved.
#   LOOM_EFFORT            Reasoning-effort level to pass as `claude --effort
#                          <value>` (issue #3705). Mirrors LOOM_MODEL: an
#                          explicit `--effort` in the passthrough args wins;
#                          when neither is set, NO --effort flag is emitted and
#                          the session/CLI default is preserved. This sets a
#                          session-default effort for the whole spawned child —
#                          the sweep escalation ladder's per-rung `@effort`
#                          cannot be threaded here because the in-session Task
#                          tool exposes no effort parameter (see sweep.md).
#   LOOM_SWEEP_NICENESS    Scheduling niceness applied to this process (and
#                          everything it execs/forks — claude, claude-wrapper,
#                          cargo, rustc, test binaries) via a `nice -n N exec`
#                          re-exec, mirroring build-gate.sh's niceness pattern
#                          (issue #4233). Precedence: this env var ->
#                          `autonomous.spawnNiceness` config -> default `10`.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_NICE=0      Disables the ENTIRE priority mechanism (nice AND
#                          taskpolicy below), restoring pre-#4233 behavior.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_TASKPOLICY_CLASS  Optional macOS `taskpolicy -c <class>`
#                          scheduling class applied in-place (e.g. "utility").
#                          Precedence: this env var ->
#                          `autonomous.spawnTaskpolicyClass` config -> unset
#                          (off by default). No-op on non-macOS or when
#                          `taskpolicy` is unavailable.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_CPU_QUOTA   Master toggle for the per-sweep CPU-quota
#                          enforcement (issue #5111). `0` disables the whole
#                          mechanism (no budget export, no quota wrap),
#                          restoring pre-#5111 behavior. Default: enabled.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_RESERVED_CORES  Cores subtracted off the host's logical core
#                          count before handing the remainder to the sweep as
#                          its CPU budget — mirrors the daemon's own
#                          `min(16, cpu_cores - 2)` agent-concurrency rule.
#                          Precedence: this env var ->
#                          `autonomous.spawnReservedCores` config -> default
#                          `2`. The resulting budget is always >= 1 core.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_SHARED_CPU_BUDGET  Toggle for the HOST-WIDE division of that
#                          budget across concurrently-running sweeps (issue
#                          #5979). `0` keeps the pre-#5979 behavior where
#                          every sweep independently claims `total -
#                          reserved`. Precedence: this env var ->
#                          `autonomous.spawnSharedCpuBudget` config ->
#                          default enabled.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_INFLIGHT_SWEEPS  Override the concurrent-sweep divisor instead
#                          of asking the local daemon for it. A test hook,
#                          and the escape hatch for a host whose concurrent
#                          agents this daemon does not track.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_INFLIGHT_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS  Hard bound on that daemon probe
#                          (default `10`). On timeout the divisor falls back
#                          to `1`, i.e. exactly pre-#5979 behavior.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_CPU_BUDGET_CORES  OUTPUT, not an input: exported into the
#                          spawned session with the computed per-sweep core
#                          budget so agent-written drivers (e.g. a SPICE
#                          batch harness) can read "how many cores may I run
#                          concurrently" from their own environment. Set on
#                          every platform, whether or not the quota below is
#                          actually kernel-enforced.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_WALLCLOCK_CEILING_SECS  Optional hard wall-clock ceiling on
#                          the ENTIRE spawned session (not each leaf process)
#                          — enforced via the systemd scope's
#                          `RuntimeMaxSec=` when a quota wrap applies.
#                          Precedence: this env var ->
#                          `autonomous.spawnWallClockCeilingSecs` config ->
#                          default `0` (disabled). Off by default for the
#                          same reason `CLAUDE_CODE_PRINT_BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS`
#                          below is forced to 0: a healthy sweep can
#                          legitimately run for hours, and this ceiling has
#                          no notion of "still making progress" — it is a
#                          blunt backstop for a genuinely runaway/orphaned
#                          batch, meant to be opted into per-repo (e.g. a
#                          sim-heavy repo bounding its whole driver, not just
#                          each leaf's own `timeout`), not a default that
#                          could kill a legitimate long build.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_CONTAINER_CPUS  Per-sweep `docker run --cpus=<value>` cap
#                          applied to a containerized dispatch (issue #7430,
#                          epic #6896 Phase 3 — the resource-limits follow-up
#                          to #7429's dispatch mode). Precedence: this env var
#                          -> `runtimes.containment.cpus` config -> the SAME
#                          host-wide CPU budget already computed above for
#                          bare-metal dispatch (`LOOM_SWEEP_CPU_BUDGET_CORES`,
#                          issues #5111/#5979) when that mechanism is enabled
#                          -> no `--cpus` flag at all (unbounded) when neither
#                          an explicit value nor a computed budget is
#                          available (e.g. `LOOM_SWEEP_CPU_QUOTA=0`).
#   LOOM_SWEEP_CONTAINER_MEMORY  Per-sweep `docker run --memory=<value>` cap
#                          (e.g. `4g`, `512m`) applied to a containerized
#                          dispatch (issue #7430). Precedence: this env var ->
#                          `runtimes.containment.memory` config -> a computed
#                          host-wide share (see `LOOM_SWEEP_CONTAINER_RESERVED_MEMORY_MB`
#                          below), mirroring the CPU budget's own host-wide
#                          division (issue #5979) so N concurrent containerized
#                          sweeps' declared caps sum to no more than the
#                          host's usable memory.
#   LOOM_SWEEP_CONTAINER_RESERVED_MEMORY_MB  MiB subtracted off the host's
#                          total physical memory before dividing the remainder
#                          into the computed `LOOM_SWEEP_CONTAINER_MEMORY`
#                          default — mirrors `LOOM_SWEEP_RESERVED_CORES` on
#                          the memory axis. Precedence: this env var ->
#                          `runtimes.containment.reservedMemoryMb` config ->
#                          default `2048` (2 GiB). The resulting budget is
#                          always >= 512 MiB.
#
# CPU-quota enforcement mechanism (issue #5111 — nothing bounded a sweep's
# CPU, so an agent-written driver ran 8 concurrent `ngspice` processes and
# saturated an entire 8-core host with no overall wall-clock/CPU limit).
# When a Linux host with a reachable `systemd --user` manager is detected
# (see lib/systemd-user.sh), the final `claude`/`claude-wrapper.sh` exec is
# wrapped in `systemd-run --user --scope -p CPUQuota=<budget*100>%`, an
# ACTUAL kernel cgroup quota: the whole process tree the sweep spawns (this
# script's own descendants, however many leaf processes it forks) can never
# collectively exceed the budget, regardless of process count — an agent
# that ignores the published `LOOM_SWEEP_CPU_BUDGET_CORES` budget is still
# contained. Killing the scope (e.g. #5110's orphan reaping) reaps every
# process inside it in one shot. On a host with no systemd --user manager
# (this fleet's macOS hosts), there is no cgroup-equivalent primitive
# available without extra tooling, so this degrades to advisory-only: the
# budget is still exported, but nothing kernel-side enforces it there yet
# (tracked as a follow-up rather than attempted in this same change).
#
# Host-wide budget sharing (issue #5979 — three concurrent sweeps, each
# correctly computing "6 of this 8-core host's cores are mine", summed to 18
# and drove the host to load 133.87). The budget above is now DIVIDED by the
# number of sweeps in flight on the host, read from `loom-daemon status
# --json` at spawn time (see lib/cpu-budget.sh's loom_cpu_inflight_sweeps).
#
# SPAWN-TIME SNAPSHOT, deliberately — not live tracking. The divisor is
# sampled ONCE, here, and never revised for the life of the sweep. A sweep
# therefore keeps a share sized for the sibling count at its own start: if
# siblings finish early it leaves headroom unclaimed, and if siblings start
# later they divide only what the newer snapshot shows. The alternative —
# continuously re-deriving each sweep's share as the host's population
# changes — would require re-applying an already-installed systemd
# `CPUQuota` to a running scope and re-publishing
# LOOM_SWEEP_CPU_BUDGET_CORES into an already-started agent process, neither
# of which any mechanism in Loom does today. The snapshot is strictly
# conservative in the direction that matters: it can only ever leave a host
# UNDER-subscribed, never over. Live re-balancing is a separate, larger
# change and is explicitly out of scope here.

# --- Sweep/role-runner spawn scheduling priority (issue #4233) ---
#
# Issue #4231 (host meltdown 2026-07-27→28: 6-way sweep fan-out, load 118/28
# cores, WindowServer watchdog-killed 5×, loom-daemon crashed) diagnosed
# STARVATION, not raw load, as the actual failure mode: sweep worker processes
# — and every build they spawn (cargo, rustc, test binaries) — run at default
# niceness (0), so under fan-out they compete head-to-head with WindowServer,
# VNC, and other system daemons for CPU.
#
# #3985/#4020/#4073/#4084 (see build-gate.sh:32-82) already ran this
# experiment from the OTHER side — nicing the build GATE up so it could never
# starve sweeps. #4020 found the extreme gate=19 starved the gate itself into
# UNEVALUATED and settled on gate=5 (a mild, measured, unprivileged-achievable
# gap above sweeps' nice-0 default); its comment (build-gate.sh:63-70)
# explicitly flagged the untried alternative — nicing sweep children UP in the
# spawn path — as deliberately not done at the time. This block does that, so
# the gap between gate and sweep niceness is now real in both directions.
#
# Applied here — the outermost point in the daemon's actual dispatch path.
# `loom-daemon` invokes THIS script directly for both sweep dispatch
# (SweepRegistryConfig::resolve_spawn_bin in
# loom-daemon/src/sweep_registry.rs) and scheduled role-runner dispatch
# (role_runner.rs) — both unattended/background paths; MOM's interactive
# terminals run `claude` directly and never go through this script, so no
# separate "interactive opt-out" is needed. spawn-worker.sh (a not-yet-wired
# future multi-runtime seam, see its own header) execs into this script for
# the "claude" runtime and is therefore covered transparently; it applies no
# priority adjustment of its own so there is no double-apply risk.
#
# Mechanism: a `nice -n N exec "$0" "$@"` re-exec — mirroring build-gate.sh's
# `LOOM_BUILD_GATE_NICED` sentinel pattern — applied before ANY child process
# (token selection, `claude`, `claude-wrapper.sh`). Because `exec` preserves
# the PID and nice/taskpolicy attributes survive exec, the whole subsequent
# process tree (this script → claude/claude-wrapper → any cargo/rustc it
# forks) inherits the adjustment with no separate handling required
# downstream. The build gate has its own independent niceness policy
# (build-gate.sh) and is never invoked through this script, so there is no
# overlap with it either.
#
# Precedence (env > config > default), the tier order used throughout loom:

#
# LOOM_SWEEP_NICE=0 disables the ENTIRE mechanism (nice AND taskpolicy),
# restoring byte-identical pre-#4233 behavior (nice 0, no taskpolicy class).
#
# Default is nice ONLY, at a moderate value (10) — deliberately above the
# gate's 5, so sweeps now yield to the gate under contention, addressing the
# #4084 CPU-contention premise as a structural side effect. `taskpolicy` is
# opt-in and unset by default: on macOS, `-c utility` is the recommended class
# if enabled — deliberately NOT `-b`/background (DARWIN_BG), which also
# throttles disk I/O and network aggressively enough to risk *causing* the
# very timeouts this issue is trying to prevent.

# --- Per-sweep CPU quota (issue #5111) ---
#
# See the header comment block above for the full rationale and env var
# reference. Unlike the niceness block above, this does NOT re-exec itself —
# it computes a budget and (on a host that can enforce it) builds a
# `systemd-run --user --scope ...` prefix array (CPU_QUOTA_WRAP) that the
# Dispatch section below prepends to the FINAL `claude`/`claude-wrapper.sh`
# exec. Wrapping only the terminal exec — rather than re-invoking this whole
# script under a wrapper, the way the niceness block re-execs itself — avoids
# having to explicitly re-plumb every already-exported env var (the OAuth
# token, LOOM_MODEL/LOOM_EFFORT flags, the safehouse MCP injection, etc.)
# through a `systemd-run` invocation that does not automatically inherit an
# arbitrary parent shell environment the way a plain `exec` does.
#
# Detachment side effect (issue #6129): `systemd-run --user --scope` creates
# its scope as a transient unit owned by the `systemd --user` manager, not by
# this process or by `loom-daemon` — the wrapped `claude`/`claude-wrapper.sh`
# ends up with the user manager as its PPID, not this script or the daemon.
# That means it survives `systemctl --user stop loom-daemon.service` (there is
# no cgroup/parent relationship for that stop job to reach) exactly like a
# launchd child survives a daemon exit, just via a different mechanism. This
# is not itself new behavior for THIS script (spawned children were always
# meant to outlive an ordinary daemon stop — see daemon_service.rs's "survive,
# don't drain" policy comment) — #6129's finding is that operators had no way
# to DELIBERATELY reap them as a group when they actually want to. See the
# `--unit=`/`--slice=` naming below (predictable enumeration) and
# `loom-daemon-quiesce.sh` (the explicit, single-command way to stop dispatch
# AND every in-flight role/sweep child on both platforms).

# --- Host-sleep prevention (issue #6311) ---
#
# #3350's check-host-sleep.sh is advisory-only by design — it warns but never
# mutates anything, so an operator re-applies the mitigation by hand on every
# host, every run. Repo-level opt-in (`host.preventSleep` in
# `.loom/config.json`, env override `LOOM_HOST_PREVENT_SLEEP`, standard
# env > config > default-OFF precedence — see lib/host-sleep-config.sh)
# self-wraps THIS spawn in `systemd-inhibit --what=idle:sleep`, exactly the
# manual remediation check-host-sleep.sh has always recommended by hand.
#
# This is the single dispatch chokepoint for BOTH named Linux entry points in
# #6311 ("sweep" and "role runner") — `loom-daemon` invokes this script
# directly for sweep dispatch (SweepRegistryConfig::resolve_spawn_bin) AND
# scheduled role-runner dispatch (role_runner.rs); MOM's interactive
# terminals run `claude` directly and never go through this script, so an
# interactive session still needs its own manual wrap (see
# check-host-sleep.sh's "Note:" addition for that case).
#
# Linux-only — systemd-inhibit talks to systemd-logind, which needs no
# privilege. macOS's reliable defense (`sudo pmset -c sleep 0`) is privileged
# and global; a repo-level config flag must NEVER invoke `sudo` silently
# (#6311's own explicit macOS guardrail), so this mechanism is a deliberate
# no-op there — check-host-sleep.sh still surfaces the manual macOS
# remediation (or, once `host.sleepMitigationAcknowledged` is set, a
# downgraded one-liner naming it).
#
# `idle:sleep` locks are HOST-WIDE, not scoped to this process's own
# children — visible via `systemd-inhibit --list` for the lifetime of this
# spawn (the #6311 acceptance criterion), and as a side effect keep every
# sibling process on the host (including a currently-idle `loom-daemon`)
# awake too, for as long as at least one sweep/role-runner spawn is in
# flight.
#
# Prefix-array composition mirrors CPU_QUOTA_WRAP immediately above: a
# `--why=probe -- true` dry run first, so a host that rejects it (no
# reachable logind, e.g. a container with no dbus) degrades to "spawn
# without the wrap" rather than replacing this process with a failing
# `systemd-inhibit` at the real exec below. Never blocks the spawn.

# --- Containerized dispatch mode (issue #7429, epic #6896 Phase 3) ---
#
# Config-selectable, initially OFF: `.loom/config.json` ->
# `runtimes.containment.enabled` (env override `LOOM_SWEEP_CONTAINERIZED`,
# standard env > config > default-off precedence). When enabled, this script
# re-execs ITSELF inside a `docker run` of the configured image (default
# ghcr.io/rjwalters/loom-worker:latest — override with
# `LOOM_SWEEP_CONTAINER_IMAGE` or `runtimes.containment.image`), under the
# path-parity mount contract (`docker/worker/MOUNT-CONTRACT.md`): the
# resolved `$WORKSPACE` (repo root — covers the main checkout AND every
# `.loom/worktrees/*` beneath it) is bind-mounted read-write at the
# IDENTICAL absolute host path, never remapped, so a sweep running in a git
# worktree builds and commits with no repo copy — git's absolute-path
# worktree pointers (`.git` gitdir files, `commondir`, object-store refs)
# resolve identically inside and outside the container (MOUNT-CONTRACT.md
# §1's "load-bearing" rule).
#
# `LOOM_SPAWN_CONTAINERIZED=1` is the recursion guard: once re-exec'd inside
# the container, this same block sees it already set and falls straight
# through to the rest of this script unchanged. Every later section — CPU
# quota (degrades to advisory-only, same as any host with no reachable
# `systemd --user` manager), sleep-inhibit, and token selection — runs
# AGAIN, this time *inside* the container, against the mount contract's
# parity-mounted paths (the token pool read-only, the build cache
# read-write) instead of being duplicated here. This is deliberate: it is
# the existing token-rotation logic in THIS script that the mount contract's
# secrets section (§2) says a worker container must use, not a
# reimplementation of it. Niceness is the one exception: `LOOM_SWEEP_NICED`
# (already exported on the host side, before this block runs) is forwarded
# through the generic `LOOM_*` env passthrough below, so the recursed
# invocation's own niceness re-exec sees its sentinel already set and
# correctly skips re-niceing a process that is, from the HOST kernel's
# perspective, still the same niced process tree.
#
# Restart-safety (issue #5119, ADR-0017 Decision 4, "The #5119 drain
# interaction, specified"): a per-sweep container is its own cgroup, owned
# by the container runtime (dockerd), not by loom-daemon's systemd unit or
# by this script's own process tree. A hard-killed daemon (a plain
# stop/restart on systemd, or any other non-drained teardown of the chain
# that dispatched this script) SIGKILLs the local `docker run` CLIENT below
# exactly like every other exec in this script — but killing that client
# does NOT stop the container it started: `docker run` needs no host-side
# supervising process to keep a container alive after dockerd has it. The
# in-flight sweep survives as an orphan relative to the daemon's in-memory
# registry — the SAME "sweeps survive by design" property launchd already
# gives bare-metal sweeps today (see daemon-reference.md), now extended to
# systemd too, via the container boundary instead of process reparenting.
# `loom-daemon restart --drain` remains the recommended path on both
# supervisors — it waits for in-flight sweeps (containerized or not) to
# finish before the daemon exits, so the orphan case above is a hard-stop
# fallback, not the common path. Reconciling a still-running orphaned
# container after a daemon restart (`SweepRegistry::reconstruct`'s
# container-recognition extension) and teaching `cancel_sweep` to `docker
# stop`/`docker rm` a containerized sweep it explicitly cancels are real,
# named Phase 3 obligations ADR-0017 defers past this issue's own scope note
# ("only add the dispatch mode itself") — tracked as a follow-up rather than
# silently assumed done.
#
# Build-cache placement (MOUNT-CONTRACT.md §4, issue #6013/#6014): a
# container that mounts no build-cache path gets a fresh, empty `target/`
# trapped in its own ephemeral writable layer on every `docker run` — worse
# than a redirected-but-persistent host cache, because then EVERY sweep pays
# a full rebuild. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is therefore resolved the SAME way the
# rest of the repo already does (`lib/cargo-target-dir.sh`: env ->
# `cargo metadata` -> `<workspace>/target`), then — only when it resolves
# OUTSIDE the already-mounted workspace — mounted at its own identical
# absolute path (parity applies to caches too) and exported into the
# container, so a containerized sweep shares the exact per-repo-per-host
# cache `post-worktree.sh`'s binary-reuse fast path already assumes, never a
# path that lives only inside the container's own filesystem.
#
# Per-sweep resource LIMITS (issue #7430, epic #6896 Phase 3 — the follow-up
# #7429's own scope note deferred: "Per-sweep resource limits ... are
# separate, LATER issues in this phase"): `docker run --cpus=<value>
# --memory=<value>` caps applied directly to the CONTAINER's own cgroup (see
# `_containment_cpus`/`_containment_memory` below), unlike the host
# CPU-quota mechanism above (issue #5111, `CPU_QUOTA_WRAP`), which is
# deliberately NOT applied to the `docker run` client itself even when
# computed: wrapping the trivial client process in a systemd scope would not
# constrain the container's own (separate) cgroup, so it would be
# decorative, not real containment. `--cpus` defaults to reusing the SAME
# host-wide CPU budget already computed for bare-metal dispatch
# (`LOOM_SWEEP_CPU_BUDGET_CORES`), and `--memory` defaults to an analogous
# host-wide share computed via `lib/memory-budget.sh` — both divided across
# in-flight sweeps exactly like the #5979 CPU fix, so N concurrent
# containerized sweeps' declared caps sum to no more than the host's usable
# resources instead of each independently claiming the whole host.

# never affected and the worker always starts. Only the socket path (no token or

# SLEEP_INHIBIT_WRAP (issue #6311) then CPU_QUOTA_WRAP (issue #5111) are
# prepended, in that order, to whichever final command is exec'd below —
# each empty (no-op) unless its own block above found a usable mechanism.
# Order composes correctly because both wraps end their own array with a
# trailing `--`: `systemd-inhibit ... -- systemd-run ... -- claude ...`. The
# `+"${arr[@]}"` guard on each is required under `set -u`: bash 3.2 (macOS's
# shipped default) treats `"${arr[@]}"` on a truly empty array as an
# unbound-variable error without it.
#
# Process-group self-reap scope note (Issue #6192): both branches below end
# in a plain `exec`, which REPLACES this process's image — nothing is left
# alive afterward to trap the leaf command's exit and reap any children it
# leaves behind, so `lib/reap-process-group.sh`'s self-reap cannot be wired in
# here without restructuring `exec` into a fork+wait, a materially riskier
# change to this script's signal/tty semantics than this issue's scope
# justifies. This is not a gap in practice for the primary daemon-dispatch
# path: `sweep_registry::dispatch` appends `--use-wrapper` by default (see
# `dispatch_appends_use_wrapper_flag`), so daemon-dispatched sweeps take the
# `USE_WRAPPER` branch into `claude-wrapper.sh`, which already runs `claude`
# as a managed child (never exec-replaces itself) and carries the self-reap
# trap directly (see its own header comment). Only a manual/interactive
# invocation that explicitly omits `--use-wrapper` reaches the raw `exec`
