# Section 6: claude-wrapper.sh script(1) calling convention (#4192)
#
# util-linux script(1) and BSD/macOS script(1) take their arguments in
# incompatible orders. _run_via_script() (extracted from run_with_retry's
# TTY branch specifically so it is unit-testable, #4192) selects the right
# form via `script --version`. These tests exercise the extracted function
# directly by sourcing the wrapper with CLAUDE_WRAPPER_SOURCE_ONLY=1 (which
# suppresses the `main "$@"` CLI entry point), rather than going through
# run_with_retry's `[ -t 0 ]` gate -- a test harness has no real TTY on
# stdin to reach that branch.

# `claude`/`claude-wrapper.sh` exec in `systemd-run --user --scope -p
# CPUQuota=<budget*100>%` (an actual kernel cgroup quota); everywhere else
# (this dev host included) it degrades to advisory-only: the computed budget
# is still exported as LOOM_SWEEP_CPU_BUDGET_CORES, but nothing wraps the
# exec. Both branches are exercised below — `LOOM_SYSTEMD_FORCE=1` (the same
# test-only seam lib/systemd-user.sh already exposes) drives the enforced
# path deterministically on any OS, including this macOS dev host.

# Every assertion in 7b above pins LOOM_SWEEP_INFLIGHT_SWEEPS=1 (see the
# suite-level export near the top), which is exactly the "one sweep on this
# host" case — so 7b doubles as the no-regression proof that a solo sweep
# still receives the full `total - reserved` budget.
#
# The tests below vary the divisor. The incident: three sweeps on an 8-core
# host each computed 6 cores and summed to 18, driving load to 133.87. The
# budget must now be this sweep's SHARE of the host, both in the exported
# advisory value (every platform) and in the enforced systemd CPUQuota
# (Linux + systemd --user only).

# Section 7e: containerized dispatch mode (issue #7429, epic #6896 Phase 3)
#
# `runtimes.containment.enabled` (env override `LOOM_SWEEP_CONTAINERIZED`)
# re-execs spawn-claude.sh itself inside `docker run <image>
# <workspace>/.loom/scripts/spawn-claude.sh <args>`. The docker stub below
# mimics real `docker run`'s behavior for `-e VAR` (no `=value`): it just
# `exec`s the trailing command in THIS shell's own environment, which is
# enough to prove BOTH the constructed command shape (path-parity mount,
# image, recursion target) and that the recursed invocation still reaches a
# real `claude` stub with token selection and args intact — mirroring the
# host's own `.loom/scripts -> ../defaults/scripts` symlink convention so
# `$CONTAIN_WS/.loom/scripts/spawn-claude.sh` resolves to the SAME script
# under test.

# permanent death emits a structured diagnostics block (exit code + classification

# ============================================================
# Section 10: claude-wrapper.sh account rotation on an auth-dead credential
# (issue #6030)
#
# A 401/invalid-bearer-token death (e.g. "Failed to authenticate. API Error:
# 401 Invalid bearer token") is a DIFFERENT failure class from exhaustion: the
# credential is revoked/invalid and will fail every future dispatch until a
# human re-authenticates it, not just until a quota window resets. Before this
# it matched no `classify_error` category, so it fell through to the generic
# RECOVERABLE catch-all and the wrapper retried the same dead credential with
# backoff until MAX_RETRIES, then died without ever marking the account bad —
# so the next spawn could pick the exact same auth-dead account again.
#
# It must now: (1) classify as TOKEN_EXPIRED, (2) mark the account bad with an
# "auth-dead: ..." reason (permanent — distinct from "exhausted: ...", which
# expires on a cooldown), (3) rotate to a healthy account and retry WITHOUT
# consuming a MAX_RETRIES attempt, and (4) still terminate with
# ACCOUNT_POOL_EXHAUSTED (not an infinite loop) when the whole pool is dead.
