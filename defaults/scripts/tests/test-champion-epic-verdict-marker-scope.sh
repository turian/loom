#
# THE FAILURE MODE THIS GUARDS AGAINST
#
# champion-epic.md's "Idempotency Guard for Unrevised Epics" reads back a
# reserved marker -- `<!-- champion:epic-verdict:body-$BODY_HASH -->` -- to
# decide whether an epic has been rejected repeatedly without revision, and
# escalates to `loom:operator-only` once the tally reaches
# LOOM_MAX_UNREVISED_EVALUATIONS. That marker is documented as
# "written by, and read for, rejections ONLY".
#
# On rjwalters/kicad-tools#4431 a *passing* verdict ("epic passes, already
# decomposed, standing down") borrowed the marker's name, because the file had
# no template for that case. The guard counted the borrowed marker as repeated
# rejection-without-revision and parked a healthy, fully-decomposed epic in the
# operator queue -- which also removed it from Step 0's completion-first check,
# so it could no longer auto-close when its last child landed.
#
# Prose alone did not prevent the misuse, so this suite makes the rule
# statically checkable, modeled on
# defaults/scripts/tests/test-epic-label-preserved-on-escalation.sh:
#
#   1. LINT -- the reserved marker is POSTED from exactly one place in
#      champion-epic.md (Step 4's rejection template), exercised against
#      pass/fail fixtures so it can never pass vacuously.
#   2. LINT -- every literal mention of the marker token lives in an
#      allowlisted section (the guard, Step 0's non-counting carve-out, Step 4).
#   3. WIRING -- the dedicated stand-down path for an already-decomposed epic
#      exists, uses its OWN marker name, is deduped per body hash, and carries
#      no escalation counter / operator-only routing.
#   4. WIRING -- the guard's prose states the single-writer rule and the
#      "only NEEDS REVISION verdicts count" rule as hard constraints, and its
#      skip/escalate branches route through the stand-down first.
#
# Hermetic: pure file reads plus a mktemp -d fixture dir. No forge/network.
