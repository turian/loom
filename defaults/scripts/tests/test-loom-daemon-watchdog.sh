# test-loom-daemon-watchdog.sh — Tests for loom-daemon-watchdog.sh, the host-side
# autonomy-loss detector (issue #4011).
#
# The watchdog compares operator INTENT (the autonomy-desired marker) against
# REALITY (daemon liveness + heartbeat freshness + — since #4398 — a bounded
# in-band IPC round-trip) and reports on divergence. This suite drives it
# entirely from files it creates in a tempdir — a real daemon is never started,
# and no invocation ever touches ~/.loom or the operator's real launchd jobs
# (liveness is exercised through the pid-file path with LOOM_DAEMON_LAUNCHD=0,
# plus one stubbed-launchctl case; the #4398 probe always runs against a stub
# binary pinned via LOOM_DAEMON_BIN, never the installed loom-daemon).
#
# Style matches the other daemon lifecycle tests — plain bash, hand-rolled
# assertions. Bats is NOT used in this repository.
#
# Exit-code contract under test:
#   0  no divergence (healthy, or no daemon expected)
#   1  DIVERGENCE reported (expected-but-not-running, wedged/stale heartbeat,
#      #4398: alive + heartbeat-fresh but the bounded IPC round-trip failed, or
#      #5118: the socket answers while the supervisor says its job is down)
#   3  #5118: liveness UNDETERMINED — no out-of-band signal AND no usable
#      in-band probe. Deliberately distinct from 1: "I cannot tell" is not
#      "the daemon is down", and defaulting to the latter is what made this
#      watchdog fire every 5 minutes fleet-wide against healthy daemons.

# $WORKDIR — this matters for the marker-ABSENT reality probe (#4331), whose

# LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE=0 is the harness DEFAULT (#4398): the pre-#4398 cases
# below assert the pid + heartbeat contract, and must not become dependent on
# whether the host happens to have a `loom-daemon` on PATH or a live socket. It
# is listed BEFORE "$@" so a caller can re-enable the probe by passing
# LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE=1 (later `env` assignments win). The dedicated probe
# cases in section 12+ do exactly that.

# (empty ⇒ "unset" in both the watchdog's resolve_pid_file and the daemon's
# daemon_pidfile.rs) so the pid-file path resolves from the MARKER, the tier
# these cases mean to exercise. Without this the suite is non-hermetic on any
# host whose daemon exports those into its agents' environment — a real
# observed failure: an inherited LOOM_PID_FILE pointed every case at the
# operator's live ~/GitHub/loom/.loom/.daemon.pid. Listed BEFORE "$@" so the
# dedicated LOOM_PID_FILE case can still set it.
#
# #5391: LOOM_WATCHDOG_AUTO_RECOVER=0 / LOOM_WATCHDOG_ESCALATE=0 are harness

# exec the real loom-daemon-start.sh (which would try to start an actual daemon
# on the test host) or file a real forge issue. Listed BEFORE "$@" so the

# The watchdog shells out to the resolved `loom-daemon` binary for its bounded

# LOOM_DAEMON_BIN — no real daemon, no real socket, no `timeout` dependency on
# the outcome. The stub is named `loom-daemon-mock`, NOT `loom-daemon` (#5548):
# it is resolved solely via LOOM_DAEMON_BIN (never a PATH lookup by name), and
# the `hang` mode below backgrounds an infinite loop that is the exact process
# shape (`bash <path ending in loom-daemon>`, orphaned) a leaked #5548-style
# fixture takes — a distinct name means a leak of this fixture, past this
# suite's traps, could never forge a production `pgrep -f loom-daemon`-style
# liveness check. Each mode reproduces one shape the classifier must handle:

# ===================================================================
# 40-45. Peer-coordination out-of-band alert (#6222, Layer 3 of #6157).
#
#         Distinct from every #5391 outage case above: the daemon here is
#         FULLY ALIVE and answering (a fresh pid + fresh heartbeat, and the
#         ordinary `quarantine list` IPC probe always succeeds) — peer
#         coordination degrading is orthogonal to liveness, which is exactly
#         why #6157 needed its own health section rather than folding into
#         the existing liveness/heartbeat contract. All cases pin
#         LOOM_WATCHDOG_ESCALATE=1 (the harness default is 0, mirroring the
#         #5391 cases' own reason for pinning it) and a fresh
#         PEER_COORD_SENTINEL path so no case can dedupe against another's
#         leftover state. Every case also pins a fresh PEER_COORD_COOLDOWN_STATE
#         path (#7258) for the identical reason: without it, cases 40-49 would
#         share ONE cooldown-state file (defaulting to <loom dir>, i.e.
#         $WORKDIR here) and test 42's recovery would poison every later
#         "expect a fresh filing" case with a cooldown it never asked for.
#         The dedicated cooldown-hysteresis cases live in 50-52 below.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# #6272 regression suite: both escalation functions' create-issue.sh
# resolution has a THIRD branch — "$_LOOM_WATCHDOG_CLI_DIR/../create-issue.sh"
# — that is NOT sandboxable via $repo_root: it resolves relative to wherever
# the watchdog SCRIPT ITSELF lives on disk. Because this suite invokes the
# watchdog from its real in-repo path, that branch, unguarded, resolves to
# THIS repo's own real, gh-authenticated defaults/scripts/create-issue.sh —
# which already filed one spurious live issue during this suite's own
# development (#6271, closed). LOOM_WATCHDOG_CREATE_ISSUE_FALLBACK_DIR (added
# by #6272) is the seam that lets these cases redirect branch 3 to a sandbox
# location instead, so none of the tests below can ever reach the real path.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---- 46. #6272: branch 3 is never reached — proven by EXECUTION, not just ----
#          if/elif ordering — when a repo-scoped create-issue.sh exists, for
#          escalate_daemon_outage(). LOOM_WATCHDOG_CREATE_ISSUE_FALLBACK_DIR
#          points at a "poison" script that records itself being called; if
#          branch 1's repo-scoped stub were not strictly preferred, the
#          poison script would fire and this test would catch it.

# #7508: STATIC guard against the bash-3.2 heredoc-in-command-substitution
#        parser bug that silently dropped escalate_peer_coordination_degraded()'s
#        issue body 1099x on a host whose launchd plist hardcodes /bin/bash
#        (macOS's stock, pre-GPLv3 3.2.57) instead of resolving a modern bash
#        off PATH. Confirmed (against a locally built bash 3.2.0 release,
#        outside this suite -- 3.2 is not assumed present in CI) that
#        wrapping a heredoc in `$(...)` trips bash 3.2's lexer whenever the
#        heredoc body contains EITHER a bare (unescaped) apostrophe anywhere,
#        OR a `#` sharing a physical line with a backtick -- producing
#        `bad substitution: no closing )` / `unexpected EOF` and an empty
#        body. These cases are dynamic-test-suite-independent (no daemon
#        stub, no forge stub) precisely because the bug is a PARSE-TIME
#        failure under bash 3.2 -- something this suite's bash (whatever
#        runs it) cannot reproduce at runtime. They instead statically assert
#        the two structural properties that make each function safe.
