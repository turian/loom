# test-merge-pr-loom-pr-label-guard.sh - Unit tests for the PRE-merge
# loom:pr review-signal guard in merge-pr.sh (#7419).
#
# Before either the auto-merge or synchronous-merge path attempts the actual
# merge API call, merge-pr.sh now runs a guard that refuses to merge a PR
# whose current head does not carry the `loom:pr` label — the only
# forge-visible signal that Judge reviewed that head. By default the guard
# HARD-BLOCKS the merge (error, exit 1), printing the current label set and
# head SHA. `--allow-unapproved` bypasses the block (records a warning and,
# on a real run, a best-effort PR comment). `--dry-run` reports the would-be
# block but never exits 1. When `loom:pr` IS present, the guard also WARNS
# (never hard-blocks) if a `<!-- champion:hold-state head=<sha> -->` marker
# in the PR's comments names a SHA different from the current head.
#
# Strategy (mirrors test-merge-pr-merge-ordering-guard.sh): the functions
# under test (_check_loom_pr_label, _check_champion_hold_state_staleness)
# depend only on globals (PR_NUMBER, REPO_NWO, PR_LABELS, PR_HEAD_SHA,
# DRY_RUN, ALLOW_UNAPPROVED) plus forge_get_pr_comments() and
# forge_gh_comment_rl_safe() (both stubbed as shell functions here, not real
# forge-helpers.sh — this test does not source that file). We extract the
# function definitions from merge-pr.sh and source them, stub their forge
# calls, then assert on exit code + emitted message. Because the block path
# calls `error` (which `exit 1`s), the guard is invoked inside a
# command-substitution subshell so the exit does not tear down the test.
# Extracting from source (rather than replicating) keeps the test in
# lockstep with the script.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-merge-pr-loom-pr-label-guard.sh

# SC2034: several globals (PR_NUMBER, REPO_NWO, PR_LABELS, PR_HEAD_SHA,
# DRY_RUN, ALLOW_UNAPPROVED) are read only by the functions extracted+sourced
# from merge-pr.sh, which shellcheck cannot see — every such assignment looks
# "unused" to the linter.

# --- Regression tests for #7678 (real `set -e` semantics) ---
#
# T8 above ("no hold-state marker at all") already exercises the right
# inputs, but `run_guard()` wraps the call in `set +e; ...; set -e` — which
# disables `-e` for the ENTIRE call, including the subshell that command
# substitution forks to run it. That is exactly the condition under which the
# #7678 bug (a pipefail-tripped `hold_head=` assignment with no `|| true`,
# unlike its sibling two lines above) does NOT reproduce, so T8 stayed green
# throughout the incident despite the bug being live and reproducible
# directly against the real script (see PR #7678 / issue #7678).
#
# The real script invokes `_check_loom_pr_label` as a bare top-level
# statement under its own `set -euo pipefail` (merge-pr.sh line ~105) — no
# enclosing `if`/`&&`/`||` and no prior `set +e`. Both of those constructs
# suppress `-e` propagation into a command-substitution subshell for the
# command they guard (a documented bash behavior, not specific to this
# guard), so simply swapping `run_guard`'s `set +e ... set -e` wrapper for an
# `if var=$(...)` wrapper does NOT fix the gap either — it reproduces the
# identical false-negative for a different reason.
#
# `run_guard_strict` below instead runs the guard in a genuinely separate
# background `bash -c '...'` process that itself sets `set -euo pipefail`
# from a clean slate (mirroring the real script's own top-level options
# exactly), then reads that child's real exit status via `wait` — `set +e` is
# only toggled around the `wait` call itself, AFTER the child has already run
# to completion under real `-e` semantics, so it cannot mask the very
# behavior under test.
