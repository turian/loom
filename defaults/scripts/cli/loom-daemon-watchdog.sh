# loom-daemon-watchdog.sh - Host-side autonomy-loss detector for the RAW
# loom-daemon process (Issue #4011).
#
# THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
#   On 2026-07-26 the loom-daemon launchd job took a SIGTERM two seconds after
#   starting and was left `bootout`-ed (unloaded) from launchd. Autonomous
#   dispatch (work finder, role runner) silently stopped. NOTHING surfaced it —
#   no log line, no forge signal, no notification. It was discovered hours later
#   only because someone happened to run `loom-daemon status` by hand. A pull
#   nobody performed for hours is not a detector.
#
# WHAT THIS IS
#   The payload of a SECOND launchd job (`<daemon-label>-watchdog`) that runs on
#   a `StartInterval` cadence, SEPARATE from the daemon job. It compares two
#   things:
#     (1) operator INTENT — the durable `autonomy-desired` marker that
#         loom-daemon-start.sh writes on a successful start and only an
#         operator-initiated loom-daemon-stop.sh removes; and
#     (2) REALITY — whether a daemon for the expected launchd label is actually
#         loaded and alive, and whether its declared-cadence heartbeat file
#         (written by the daemon, #4011) is fresh.
#   When intent says "a daemon should be running" but reality disagrees, it
#   REPORTS loudly (a timestamped line to the watchdog log + stderr, which
#   launchd captures) instead of staying silent — and, since #5391, it also
#   RECOVERS: a confirmed-down daemon is restarted under bounded retries with
#   exponential backoff behind a circuit breaker, escalating to a forge issue
#   (not just a logfile) once the attempt budget is spent. See "GENERAL-CASE
#   BOUNDED RECOVERY + CIRCUIT BREAKER (#5391)" below for the full policy and
#   the reasoning behind recovering rather than only reporting.
#
# WHY A SECOND LAUNCHD JOB, NOT A RESIDENT PROCESS
#   The reporter must live OUTSIDE the daemon process: a dead daemon cannot
#   report its own death (which is why #3971's in-daemon watch loop is not
#   reusable here). And it must itself be supervised — but a long-lived resident
#   watchdog just moves the "who watches the watchdog" problem up one level (it
#   too can crash and stay dead). A `StartInterval` job owns NO long-lived
#   process: launchd re-runs it every interval regardless of how the last run
#   exited, so it structurally cannot crash-and-stay-dead. That is what resolves
#   the recursion.
#
# WHY THE MARKER, NOT "is the pid file / launchd job present"
#   loom-daemon-stop.sh boots out the job AND deletes the pid file, so after ANY
#   stop those would be gone — making a deliberately-stopped daemon and a
#   silently-dead one byte-identical. A detector built on them would page on
#   every intentional stop or never page at all. The marker's lifetime is
#   OPERATOR INTENT: present ⇒ a daemon is expected; absent ⇒ it was
#   deliberately stopped (or never started) ⇒ stay silent.
#
# HANG-AWARE IPC LIVENESS PROBE (#4398)
#   Process-exists + heartbeat-fresh are BOTH out-of-band signals: neither ever
#   talks to the daemon over the socket it actually serves work on. Two observed
#   incidents show why that is not enough:
#     - #4381: the installed loom-daemon binary was replaced by a stub that
#       answered `--version` and then hung forever. A pid-alive check passes
#       against that indefinitely.
#     - 2026-07-29: the production daemon (pid 1484) was alive AND writing a
#       FRESH heartbeat while every `loom-daemon status` round-trip hung. The
#       heartbeat writer (`daemon_heartbeat::spawn_heartbeat_task`) and the IPC
#       accept loop are independent `tokio::spawn`ed tasks on a multi-threaded
#       runtime, so one can keep ticking while the other is wedged.
#   So after liveness is confirmed, this job also runs a BOUNDED in-band IPC
#   round-trip through the installed loom-daemon CLI. Design points:
#     * BOUNDED TWICE. The CLI bounds its own connect + round-trip (5s each,
#       `query_daemon_bounded`); this job additionally wraps the invocation in a
#       hard external timeout, so even a CLI that never returns at all (the
#       #4381 stub) cannot hang the watchdog tick.
#     * LIGHTWEIGHT SUBCOMMAND, NOT `status`. The probe defaults to
#       `quarantine list` — a pure IPC round-trip with no post-reply work.
#       `loom-daemon status --json` looks like the obvious probe but, AFTER a
#       successful round-trip, it also runs a per-account token-pool network
#       check plus a self-update check; measured at 15.3s against a HEALTHY
#       daemon, which would make the probe timeout itself the false-positive
#       generator. Override with LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_ARGS if desired.
#     * DEBOUNCED. A single failed round-trip can be transient contention (a
#       per-connection task dropping a `status` under concurrent-sweep load —
#       #4279). One failure is REPORTED (loud, logged) but only N consecutive
#       failures, tracked in <loom_dir>/.watchdog-probe-fail-count and keyed to
#       the live pid, are called a CONFIRMED hang.
#     * STARTUP-GRACE AWARE. For up to ~90s after a supervised relaunch the
#       socket may not be bound yet even though launchd reports a live pid
#       (#4213). A probe against a process younger than the grace window is
#       skipped entirely and never counts toward the confirmed-hang tally —
#       the same window `daemon_install_state::DEFAULT_STARTUP_GRACE_SECS`
#       uses, so `status` and this watchdog cannot disagree.
#     * GRACEFULLY DEGRADING. No resolvable loom-daemon binary, a build whose
#       CLI does not know the probe subcommand, or any daemon-side application
#       error (the IPC round-trip demonstrably WORKED) skips the probe rather
#       than inventing a divergence. The probe must never become a new hard
#       dependency that pages on its own absence.
#     * REPORT-ONLY, DELIBERATELY. Unlike #4232's narrow auto-`kickstart`, there
#       is NO provably-safe unattended remediation for a wedged-but-alive
#       process: the only real fix is killing it, which would also kill a daemon
#       that is merely under heavy legitimate load. A confirmed hang therefore
#       escalates to a maximally actionable DIVERGENCE report (exit 1) with the
#       explicit recovery commands — never an automatic kill/restart.
#
# TICK-GRANULARITY DETECTION LATENCY IS AN ACCEPTED TRADEOFF (#5790)
#   An operator saw `loom-daemon status` itself time out on IPC twice ~20
#   minutes apart (one successful `status` in between) while this watchdog's
#   own log read `[OK] daemon healthy` throughout. Two independent, additive
#   mechanisms explain that without the probe being absent or broken:
#     1. SUB-TICK WEDGES ARE STRUCTURALLY INVISIBLE. This probe samples ONCE
#        per StartInterval tick (default LOOM_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SECS=300, see
#        defaults/docs/daemon-reference.md). A wedge that resolves faster than
#        one tick interval can fall entirely between two samples and never be
#        observed at all. This is inherent to any periodic sampled probe, not
#        a bug: closing it completely would require continuous polling or
#        multiple samples per tick, trading resource cost and forge-issue /
#        log noise for lower latency — a real design change, deliberately left
#        as future work rather than folded into this fix.
#     2. A SUB-THRESHOLD DIVERGENCE USED TO BE MASKED BY THE SAME TICK'S OK
#        LINE. Before #5790, a tick whose probe DID fire during a wedge and
#        correctly logged a sub-threshold `[DIVERGENCE] ... consecutive
#        failure N of <threshold>` line then fell through to section 4 and
#        unconditionally appended `[OK] daemon healthy ...` right after it —
#        so an operator or log-scraper reading only the last line, or grepping
#        for `[OK]`, saw a clean bill of health in the SAME tick a divergence
#        was already reported. #5790 fixes this specific defect (see
#        `report_heartbeat_ok()` below): that OK line now folds in the
#        divergence instead of reading as unambiguously healthy. This was a
#        pure reporting defect — the exit code (via `exit_ok()`) already
#        reflected `PROBE_DIVERGED` correctly, so any consumer keyed off exit
#        code alone (rather than the log text) was never misled by it.
#   Given (2) is now fixed, ANY wedge that persists through at least one full
#   tick is reported the very tick it is observed — detection latency for that
#   class is bounded by ONE tick (≤300s by default), not by
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_FAIL_THRESHOLD (that threshold only gates the
#   CONFIRMED/report-vs-recover distinction, never whether a single failure is
#   reported at all — see "consecutive failure N of threshold" above). Only
#   (1), sub-tick-duration wedges, remains genuinely undetectable by this
#   probe's design, and this default cadence — 300s ticks, 3-consecutive
#   CONFIRMED threshold — is kept as the correct tradeoff: it already reports
#   every observed divergence immediately (loud, unconditional stderr, logged
#   regardless of --verbose) while reserving the escalation-worthy CONFIRMED
#   label and its exit-1-every-tick behavior for a hang proven to be sustained
#   across debounced samples (#4279's transient-contention rationale, above).
#   Lowering the default interval would shrink the sub-tick blind spot but
#   raise per-host probe overhead and false-positive risk fleet-wide for a
#   marginal gain; that tradeoff is not taken here without fleet data
#   justifying it.
#
# A WINDOWED/RATE FAILURE SIGNAL, ALONGSIDE THE CONSECUTIVE ONE (#5944)
#   Both mechanisms above — the same-tick fold-in (#5790) and the CONFIRMED
#   escalation (#4398) — key off `probe_fail_count_*`, a streak that is reset
#   to ZERO by a single successful round-trip ("ends any prior failure streak
#   outright", see that function's own comment). That reset is exactly right
#   for the CONFIRMED-hang decision — a hang that heals on its own should not
#   count toward the next one — but it leaves a THIRD failure shape
#   unhandled: a probe that fails, succeeds, fails, succeeds... under host
#   load, never 3-in-a-row. Every individual failing tick still gets its own
#   sub-threshold DIVERGENCE line (unchanged, and still correct), but each
#   intervening SUCCESS resets the streak to zero and reports a bare
#   `[OK] daemon healthy` for that tick — so hours of intermittent failure
#   never accumulate into anything an operator or log-scraper skimming the
#   last line, or grepping for `[OK]`, would notice. Observed live on a host
#   at load 45-65 across 28 cores: `loom-daemon status` timed out on
#   essentially every operator invocation for hours while this watchdog's log
#   read `[OK] daemon healthy` throughout.
#
#   The fix is a SECOND, independent tally: a rolling WINDOW of the last
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_WINDOW_TICKS probe outcomes (default 6 — 30
#   minutes at the default 300s cadence), keyed to the live pid exactly like
#   the consecutive tally (a relaunched daemon starts a fresh window, same
#   reasoning as #4398's pid-keyed streak: a fresh process must never inherit
#   its wedged predecessor's history). Unlike the consecutive tally, a single
#   SUCCESS does NOT clear this history — only the window sliding an old tick
#   out of range does. When LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_WINDOW_FAIL_THRESHOLD
#   (default 3) or more of the last WINDOW_TICKS ticks failed, even a tick
#   whose OWN round-trip just succeeded is reported DEGRADED (not a bare OK,
#   via `report_heartbeat_ok()`'s existing PROBE_DIVERGED fold-in — the same
#   plumbing #5790 built, reused rather than duplicated) and the tick's exit
#   code reflects it (non-zero), carrying the host load average at probe time
#   (`get_load_average()`, #5790) so the report doubles as the load-contention
#   diagnosis.
#
#   Deliberately weaker than a CONFIRMED hang: the windowed signal is
#   report-only, never escalates to the "IPC UNRESPONSIVE (CONFIRMED)" text,
#   its exit-1-no-remediation posture, or the #5391 bounded-recovery path —
#   the daemon DID answer on the ticks in between, which is real evidence
#   against a genuine wedge (#4279's transient-contention rationale). The
#   default threshold (3 of the last 6) also will not fire on a single
#   isolated failure — that already gets its own sub-threshold DIVERGENCE
#   line via the unchanged #5790 path and is not this mechanism's job.
#
# SOCKET-FIRST LIVENESS, PID FILE DEMOTED TO A HINT (#5118)
#   Until #5118 the OUT-OF-BAND probe above was the ONLY thing that could
#   establish liveness, and on a host with neither a launchd job nor a
#   systemd-managed unit to ask, that reduced to a single artifact: the pid
#   file. Three stacked defects made that unusable fleet-wide:
#     1. PATH DISAGREEMENT. This script derived the pid file from the SOCKET's
#        directory (`<dirname $LOOM_SOCKET_PATH>/.daemon.pid`) in the
#        marker-absent path, while the daemon derives it from the START
#        SCRIPT's `LOOM_PID_FILE` / the workspace (`daemon_pidfile.rs`). On a
#        workspace-rooted install those are never the same directory.
#     2. `LOOM_PID_FILE` WAS IGNORED HERE. It is exported by
#        loom-daemon-start.sh and baked into every plist/unit it renders — and
#        honored by the daemon as precedence tier 1 — but this script had no
#        support for it at all, so the one variable that is supposed to
#        single-source the path could not align the two ends.
#     3. A STALE pid file reads as a CONFIRMED death. A pid file naming a
#        long-dead pid (#4774, before the daemon self-wrote it at bind) is
#        indistinguishable here from "no daemon".
#   Observed 2026-08-03: BOTH fleet hosts ran healthy daemons while this
#   watchdog reported `[DIVERGENCE] ... no live pid file at ~/.loom/.daemon.pid`
#   every five minutes since 2026-08-01. An alarm that is always on carries no
#   information — and two genuine outages that same session were
#   indistinguishable from it.
#
#   The fix inverts the precedence to match what `loom-daemon health` already
#   does: the IPC ROUND-TRIP IS AUTHORITATIVE, the pid file is a corroborating
#   hint. Concretely, when the out-of-band probe does NOT find a live daemon
#   this script now ASKS THE SOCKET before reporting anything:
#     * socket ANSWERS + no supervisor was consulted (pid-file path) ⇒ HEALTHY.
#       The pid file's absence/staleness is a note, never a page.
#     * socket ANSWERS + the supervisor (launchd/systemd) says its job is down
#       ⇒ a WARN state mismatch: a daemon is serving work but nothing is
#       supervising it. Auto-remediation is SUPPRESSED — kickstarting a second
#       daemon at a socket a live one already owns only produces a refusal.
#     * socket is UNREACHABLE ⇒ the daemon really is down: the existing
#       DIVERGENCE + bounded auto-remediation path, unchanged.
#     * liveness CANNOT BE DETERMINED (no probe available — no resolvable
#       binary, probe disabled, CLI wedged — AND no usable pid file) ⇒ a
#       DISTINCT `UNKNOWN` report and exit 3. Defaulting to "the daemon is
#       gone" is what manufactured the permanent false positive; an alerting
#       component must say "I cannot tell" in its own words.
#   The pid file's PATH is also now derived by the same precedence the daemon
#   uses (`LOOM_PID_FILE` > the marker's `pid_file=` > machine/workspace >
#   `<loom dir>`), so the two ends can no longer disagree about which file
#   they mean.
#
# BOUNDED AUTO-REMEDIATION (#4232)
#   The watchdog was deliberately report-only until #4232: on 2026-07-28 a
#   `loom-daemon restart` was ack'd (the running daemon exited 0, honoring its
#   #4054/#4077 restart contract) but launchd never relaunched it — the
#   watchdog could describe that outage but not fix it, which matters once
#   #4055's unattended self-update path can hit the same race with no operator
#   watching. This job now auto-runs `launchctl kickstart <label>` (PLAIN,
#   NEVER `-k`) for EXACTLY ONE divergence signature: the launchd job is
#   LOADED (launchctl still knows about it) + NOT running + its last exit
#   status was 0. That signature can ONLY arise from a restart-primitive exit
#   that launchd failed to honor — an operator SIGTERM stop exits 143/130
#   (loom-daemon-stop.sh), a crash exits non-zero, and a booted-out/never-
#   loaded job fails `launchctl print` outright. Every other divergence stays
#   report-only, exactly as before: no crash-loop revival, no reviving a
#   deliberate stop.
#
#   #4862 adds the systemd --user mirror of this gate: a clean main-process
#   exit (ExecMainCode=exited, ExecMainStatus=0) with the unit LOADED but not
#   running auto-runs 'systemctl --user reset-failed <unit> && systemctl
#   --user start <unit>' — the systemd analog of 'launchctl kickstart', for
#   the exact "Restart=on-success didn't fire" incident #4862 reported (and
#   the render_systemd_unit KillMode=mixed fix in loom-daemon-start.sh
#   addresses at the source). Same narrow construction: an operator stop, a
#   genuine crash, or a never-installed unit cannot produce this signature.
#
# GENERAL-CASE BOUNDED RECOVERY + CIRCUIT BREAKER (#5391)
#   THE DECISION: this watchdog RECOVERS. It is not a report-only detector.
#
#   The #4232/#4862 gates above only ever covered ONE divergence signature
#   ("loaded + down + last exit 0"). Every other confirmed outage — a genuine
#   crash, a booted-out job, a never-relaunched unit, a dead pid with an
#   unreachable socket — fell through to a plain `[DIVERGENCE] … Recover with:
#   loom-daemon-start.sh` line and stopped there. Observed on one fleet host:
#   252 such lines between 2026-07-28 and 2026-08-05, including a single
#   continuous 1h40m outage that ended only because a human went looking. A
#   detector that prints the exact recovery command every five minutes and never
#   runs it is, operationally, indistinguishable from no watchdog at all.
#
#   The counter-argument to auto-restarting is real: a naive reviver pointed at
#   a genuinely broken binary becomes a restart loop that burns tokens, hides
#   the real fault, and hammers the forge. So this is deliberately NOT a naive
#   reviver. Four constraints bound it:
#
#     1. BOUNDED ATTEMPTS. At most LOOM_WATCHDOG_RECOVER_MAX_ATTEMPTS (default
#        5) recovery attempts per outage EPISODE — not per tick. The tally is
#        durable (<loom dir>/.watchdog-recovery-state) so it survives the fact
#        that each tick is a brand-new process, and it is cleared the moment a
#        tick observes a healthy daemon (that, not a timer, is what ends an
#        episode).
#     2. EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF. Attempt N is only made once
#        base × 2^(N-1) seconds (base LOOM_WATCHDOG_RECOVER_BACKOFF_SECS=60,
#        capped at LOOM_WATCHDOG_RECOVER_BACKOFF_CAP_SECS=1800) have elapsed
#        since the last attempt. Ticks inside the backoff window still report,
#        they just do not re-run the recovery command. The attempt is recorded
#        BEFORE the command runs, so an overlapping tick cannot double-fire it.
#     3. CIRCUIT BREAKER. Once the attempt budget is spent the breaker LATCHES
#        OPEN: no further automatic attempts are made for this episode, at all,
#        until either a tick observes a healthy daemon or an operator deletes
#        the state file. A broken binary therefore gets at most 5 restarts,
#        never an unbounded loop.
#     4. NEVER REVIVES A DELIBERATE STOP — KEYED ON THE MARKER, NOT THE EXIT
#        CODE (#6388). A scripted stop (loom-daemon-stop.sh) removes the
#        autonomy-desired marker BEFORE it kills the daemon, so a deliberate
#        stop never reaches this block at all — the marker-ABSENT branch near
#        the top of this script is the ONLY place "never revive" fires, and it
#        fires unconditionally there, before any exit code is ever read. A
#        signal-shaped exit code recorded HERE (marker confirmed present) —
#        launchd `last exit status` 143/130/-15/-2; systemd
#        ExecMainCode=killed with TERM/INT — used to be misread as the SAME
#        "operator stop" intent and skipped recovery outright; a stray SIGTERM
#        (e.g. an unrelated test run) then reads exactly like a deliberate
#        stop and starves autonomy for as long as no human notices (an 11h
#        outage, #6388). It is now just another kind of death: it gets the
#        SAME bounded recovery as any other crash, with the signal named in
#        the report text so an operator can see which rule fired.
#
#   WHAT IT RUNS: the sibling ./loom-daemon-start.sh — the exact command this
#   watchdog has always printed — replaying ONLY the autonomy flags the last
#   start persisted to `<state home>/.daemon.flags` (#3968), filtered through a
#   strict allowlist so the FLAGS-OFF/opt-in contract can never widen across a
#   recovery. The invocation is wrapped in a hard wall-clock budget
#   (LOOM_WATCHDOG_RECOVER_TIMEOUT_SECS, default 120) so a wedged start can
#   never wedge the tick. Override the whole command with
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_RECOVER_CMD; disable recovery entirely with
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_AUTO_RECOVER=0 (the watchdog then says so explicitly in its
#   own DIVERGENCE text, so an operator can never mistake a report-only host
#   for a self-healing one).
#
#   ESCALATION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE TAILING A LOGFILE. When the breaker trips —
#   or when recovery is structurally impossible on this host (disabled, no
#   resolvable start script) and the outage has persisted for
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_RECOVER_MAX_ATTEMPTS consecutive ticks — the watchdog files
#   ONE tracking issue on the forge via ./.loom/scripts/create-issue.sh (never a
#   bare `gh issue create`), reusing the escalation channel #5343 already
#   established in loom-daemon-start.sh. It is deduped by a persistent sentinel
#   (<loom dir>/.watchdog-outage-escalated) so a multi-hour outage files exactly
#   one issue, and the sentinel is cleared with the rest of the episode state as
#   soon as a daemon is seen healthy again — so the NEXT outage escalates again.
#   Best-effort and non-fatal: no forge auth, offline, or no create-issue.sh
#   degrades to the log line it always was.
#
# EXIT CODES (a StartInterval/OnUnitActiveSec job's exit code does not affect
# relaunch — these exist for testability and for a human running it by hand):
#   0  no divergence — daemon healthy, OR no daemon expected AND none running
#      (marker absent + nothing alive), OR the #4232/#4862 bounded
#      auto-remediation (see above) successfully relaunched it via
#      'launchctl kickstart' / 'systemctl --user start', OR (#5391) the
#      general-case bounded recovery successfully relaunched it via
#      loom-daemon-start.sh
#   1  DIVERGENCE / state mismatch reported — a daemon is expected but is not
#      running (and either the #4232 remediation gate did not apply, or it fired
#      but the daemon is still not confirmed running, or #5391's bounded
#      recovery ran/was deferred/was suppressed and the daemon is still down),
#      or is running but its
#      heartbeat is stale (possibly wedged), OR (#4398) it is running with a
#      fresh heartbeat but its bounded IPC round-trip failed, OR (#5944) its
#      round-trip succeeded THIS tick but failed often enough across the
#      recent windowed history to report DEGRADED anyway, OR (#4331) a daemon
#      IS running while the marker is ABSENT (crash protection disarmed — a WARN
#      state mismatch), OR (#5118) the socket answers while the supervisor says
#      its job is down (an UNSUPERVISED daemon — serving work, but not crash
#      protected)
#   2  usage error
#   3  (#5118) LIVENESS UNDETERMINED — deliberately NOT exit 1: no out-of-band
#      signal found a live daemon AND the in-band socket probe could not run (no
#      resolvable loom-daemon binary, the probe is disabled, or the CLI itself
#      never returned), so this tick has NO EVIDENCE either way. Reported as
#      UNKNOWN, never as "the daemon is down".

#                                 uses (daemon_pidfile.rs) and the value

#                                 / systemd unit it renders. Wins over the

#                                 only ever a CORROBORATING hint here: the

#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL            macOS: the DAEMON label to probe (default com.rjwalters.loom-daemon)
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_DOMAIN          macOS: pin the launchd domain (gui/<uid> or user/<uid>);

#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_SYSTEMD_PROBE   #4862: 1/true/yes: opt in to the systemd --user

#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_RECOVER_CMD     #5391: override the recovery command (argv,
#                                word-split). Default: the sibling
#                                loom-daemon-start.sh + the allowlisted autonomy
#                                flags persisted in <state home>/.daemon.flags.
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_RECOVERY_STATE  #5391: path to the durable episode state

#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_ESCALATION_SENTINEL  #5391: dedupe sentinel for that escalation
#                                (default <loom dir>/.watchdog-outage-escalated).
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE       #4398: 0/false/no disables the bounded in-band

#                                probe (default 15). Must stay comfortably above
#                                the CLI's own 5s connect + 5s round-trip bound.
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_ARGS  #4398: the loom-daemon argv used as the probe
#                                (default 'quarantine list' — a pure IPC
#                                round-trip with no post-reply work).
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_FAIL_THRESHOLD  #4398: consecutive failed probes

#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_GRACE_SECS  #4398: post-relaunch socket-bind grace

#                                (default: LOOM_DAEMON_STARTUP_GRACE_SECS, else 90).

#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_WINDOW_TICKS  #5944: size (in ticks) of the rolling
#                                window used for the rate-based failure signal,
#                                alongside (not instead of) the consecutive
#                                tally above (default 6 — 30 minutes at the
#                                default 300s cadence).
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_WINDOW_FAIL_THRESHOLD  #5944: failures within the

#                                DEGRADED verdict even on a tick whose own
#                                round-trip succeeded (default 3). Report-only,
#                                distinct from the CONFIRMED-hang escalation:
#                                never triggers exit-1-no-remediation posture
#                                changes or #5391 bounded recovery on its own.
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_IPC_PROBE_WINDOW_STATE  #5944: path to the rolling-window
#                                state (default <loom dir>/.watchdog-probe-window).
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_LOAD_AVG_PROC_PATH  #5790: test seam for the /proc/loadavg
#                                source get_load_average() reads on Linux
#                                (default /proc/loadavg). Not meant for
#                                production use — point it at an unreadable
#                                path to exercise the "unavailable" degrade.
#   LOOM_FORCE_PORTABLE_TIMEOUT    #4398, renamed from the watchdog-local
#                                LOOM_WATCHDOG_FORCE_PORTABLE_TIMEOUT by #4832
#                                when bounded_run() moved to the shared
#                                lib/bounded-run.sh: 1 forces the built-in
#                                bounded runner instead of `timeout(1)` (test
#                                seam for the default macOS no-`timeout` shape).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN               Explicit loom-daemon binary for the IPC probe
#                                (same resolution order as loom-daemon-start.sh).
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_PEER_COORD_CHECK  #6222 (Layer 3 of #6157): 0/false/no disables
#                                the peer-coordination alert entirely (default: on).
#                                Only ever attempted on a tick whose own IPC
#                                round-trip already succeeded (`probe_verdict ==
#                                healthy`) — never adds a new hang surface.
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_PEER_COORD_TIMEOUT_SECS  #6222: hard external budget for the
#                                `loom-daemon peer-claims --json` query (default:
#                                same as LOOM_WATCHDOG_STATUS_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS).
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_PEER_COORD_SENTINEL  #6222: dedupe sentinel for the peer-
#                                coordination escalation (default <loom dir>
#                                /.watchdog-peer-coordination-escalated). Stores
#                                `<timestamp> <issue-url>` so recovery can
#                                comment on and close the exact filed issue.
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_PEER_COORD_COOLDOWN_SECS  #7258: post-recovery hysteresis —
#                                after clear_peer_coordination_escalation()
#                                closes an episode's tracking issue, a repeat
#                                DEGRADED excursion within this many seconds is
#                                suppressed (logged, no new issue filed) rather
#                                than filing a fresh one. Default 21600 (6h),
#                                comfortably above the ~1-2h flap interval
#                                observed on a flapping host (#7258). This is
#                                LAYERED ON TOP of, and does not replace, the
#                                PEER_COORD_SENTINEL within-episode dedupe
#                                above — it only governs repeat episodes AFTER
#                                a recovery already cleared that sentinel. The
#                                comparison is strict `<` (elapsed < cooldown):
#                                an excursion landing exactly AT the boundary
#                                is treated as cooldown-elapsed and escalates
#                                fresh, same as one landing after it. 0
#                                disables the cooldown outright (fires every
#                                time, today's behavior).
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_PEER_COORD_COOLDOWN_STATE  #7258/#7664: path to the cooldown
#                                state file a successful recovery writes
#                                (default <loom dir>
#                                /.watchdog-peer-coordination-cooldown), read
#                                back by the next escalation attempt. A
#                                missing OR corrupt/non-numeric file fails
#                                OPEN — treated as "no cooldown in effect",
#                                i.e. today's fire-every-time behavior — never
#                                an error and never a reason to skip
#                                escalating a genuine degradation. #7664 widened
#                                the file's format from a bare epoch to
#                                `<epoch> <issue-ref> <flap-count>` (still
#                                parsed via `read`, so an old bare-epoch file
#                                from before #7664 keeps working — the extra
#                                fields just read empty and the dedup window
#                                below fails open exactly like a corrupt file).
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_PEER_COORD_DEDUP_WINDOW_SECS  #7664: a REPEAT DEGRADED
#                                excursion landing after the #7258 cooldown
#                                above has elapsed, but still within this many
#                                seconds of the last recovery, comments on (and
#                                reopens if needed) the SAME tracking issue
#                                that cooldown window's recovery closed —
#                                instead of calling create-issue.sh again —
#                                and bumps a running flap count carried in
#                                PEER_COORD_COOLDOWN_STATE. This is the fix for
#                                a chronically-flapping host (anvil#1270):
#                                the #7258 cooldown alone still refiles once
#                                per cooldown window forever; this widens the
#                                same-issue window so a flapping host
#                                accumulates comments on ONE tracking issue
#                                instead of a fresh issue every cooldown cycle.
#                                Default 86400 (24h) — deliberately longer than
#                                the default 21600s (6h) cooldown so it covers
#                                at least one full cooldown cycle of slack. A
#                                non-numeric override fails open to the
#                                default. Comparison is strict `<`, matching
#                                the cooldown boundary convention: an excursion
#                                landing exactly AT the window boundary is
#                                treated as window-elapsed and files a fresh
#                                issue, resetting the flap count to 1. Any
#                                failure along this path — no `gh` on PATH, a
#                                missing/corrupt issue reference in the state
#                                file, or a failed `gh issue comment`/`reopen`
#                                call — FAILS OPEN to filing a fresh issue,
#                                same fail-open contract as the cooldown state
#                                file itself: a genuine degradation is never
#                                silently dropped.

# `status`" note in this file's header — the same 15s-against-a-healthy-daemon
# trap that made `quarantine list` the IPC probe's own choice, not `status`).
# `peer-claims` is a single IPC round-trip with no such fan-out, carrying the

# episode's RECOVERY — so a host that flaps degraded/healthy every 1-2 hours
# does not file a brand-new tracking issue on every flap. Sets the global
# PEER_COORD_ESCALATE_SKIP_REASON to "cooldown" (and PEER_COORD_COOLDOWN_REMAINING
# to the seconds left) when suppressed this way, so the caller's log line can
# say WHY no issue was filed instead of conflating it with a hard failure
# (missing create-issue.sh / forge auth / offline host).
#
# #7664: the #7258 cooldown alone still files a BRAND NEW issue once per
# cooldown window forever on a chronically-flapping host (anvil#1270: 10
# issues over ~68h even with the cooldown active). Once the cooldown has
# elapsed, this now checks PEER_COORD_DEDUP_WINDOW_SECS — a longer window
# also anchored to the last recovery — and if the excursion is still inside
# it AND the cooldown-state file has a usable issue reference, COMMENTS ON
# (and reopens) that same tracking issue instead of filing a new one, bumping
# a running flap count. Sets PEER_COORD_ESCALATE_MODE to "dedup" (with
# PEER_COORD_DEDUP_ISSUE_REF / PEER_COORD_DEDUP_FLAP_COUNT populated) so the
# caller's log line can say a comment was posted rather than a fresh filing.
# Any failure along this path (no `gh`, no/corrupt issue reference, a failed

peer-claim coordination has gone DEGRADED again on \`$hostname_str\` (${PEER_COORD_SUMMARY:-see the daemon peer-claims report}).

**Suspected cause** (unverified, per anvil#1270): \`advertised\` only moves at dispatch time, so a RAM/disk-throttled host with cap 0 never advertises and cannot reach the sustained-receive recovery threshold.

The \`peer_coordination\` section of \`loom-daemon health\` has gone DEGRADED on host
\`$hostname_str\`. This host's one-way peer-claim RECEIVE path (Safehouse, #6157)
can no longer be trusted to prove another host has already claimed an issue.
This is diagnostic only since Epic #6165 Phase 4 (#6317): it no longer freezes
stale-claim reclamation, which now gates solely on the lease record (#6286)
(see \`.loom/docs/safehouse.md\` -> "Peer-claim coordination: cross-host soft
claim (#4028)").

- **Verdict**: $PEER_COORD_SUMMARY
- **Degraded for**: ${PEER_COORD_DEGRADED_FOR:-unknown}s
- **Recovery progress**: ${PEER_COORD_CONSECUTIVE:-0}/${PEER_COORD_RECOVERY_THRESHOLD:-?} consecutive sustained receive(s) toward recovery
- **Watchdog log**: \`$WATCHDOG_LOG\`

**To recover by hand**: run \`loom-daemon peer-claims\` (or \`loom-daemon health\`)
on \`$hostname_str\` to confirm the live \`peer_coordination\` state, and check
Safehouse connectivity to peer hosts (\`.loom/docs/safehouse.md\`).

**This alert clears itself** — no manual close needed. Filed automatically by
the loom-daemon-watchdog.sh peer-coordination escalation (#6222, Layer 3 of
