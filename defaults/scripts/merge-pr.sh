# Loom PR Merge - Worktree-safe merge using forge API (GitHub or Gitea)
# Usage: ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh <pr-number> [options]
#
# Merges a PR via the forge API (not `gh pr merge`) to avoid
# "already used by worktree" errors when merging from inside a worktree.
#
# Supports both GitHub and Gitea forges. Forge detection is automatic
# (see forge-helpers.sh for details).
#
# Options:
#   --no-cleanup-worktree  Skip local worktree AND local branch cleanup after
#                          merge
#   --cleanup-worktree     (no-op, worktree cleanup is now the default)
#   --worktree-path <dir>  Explicit worktree path to clean up (bypasses
#                          .loom-managed sentinel guard — caller asserts
#                          responsibility). Also deletes the matching local
#                          branch via `git branch -d` (refuses on unmerged
#                          commits — Git's own safety check).
#   --dry-run              Show what would happen without merging
#   --auto                 Enable auto-merge instead of immediate merge. On a
#                          repo with GitHub auto-merge disabled
#                          (allow_auto_merge:false) this degrades gracefully to
#                          wait-for-checks-then-merge (immediate if CLEAN)
#                          instead of failing (#3820).
#   --allow-stacked-children
#                          Bypass the pre-merge merge-ordering guard when the
#                          parent branch (feature/issue-N) still has open
#                          stacked child PRs targeting it (operator asserts the
#                          children are already reconciled). See #3747 item 2.
#   --allow-unapproved     Bypass the pre-merge loom:pr review-signal guard,
#                          which otherwise hard-blocks merging a PR whose
#                          current head carries no loom:pr label (no
#                          forge-visible signal Judge reviewed it — e.g. a
#                          Doctor rebase cleared it via the staleness guard).
#                          The bypass is recorded as a warning and, on a real
#                          (non-dry-run) merge, best-effort as a PR comment
#                          audit trail. Operator asserts responsibility,
#                          mirroring --allow-stacked-children. See #7419.
#   --no-cleanup-primary   Skip the automatic primary-checkout branch cleanup
#                          (#5015): when the merged branch is checked out in
#                          the PRIMARY repo checkout (not a worktree) and it
#                          is provably safe (clean tree, no stash entries,
#                          tip matches the merged PR head SHA), the script
#                          normally checks out the default branch there and
#                          deletes the merged branch automatically instead of
#                          just printing manual instructions. Pass this to
#                          always print the manual instructions instead.
#   --cleanup-primary      (no-op, primary-checkout cleanup is the default)
#
# By default, the local worktree AND the local branch it held are cleaned up
# after a successful merge (#4100). Pass --no-cleanup-worktree to skip both
# (e.g., when other terminals may have their CWD inside the worktree, or the
# branch has unpushed commits you want to keep).
#
# Cleanup is restricted to Loom-managed worktrees (those containing the
# .loom-managed sentinel written by worktree.sh). Worktrees lacking the
# sentinel are treated as user-owned and never removed. Set
# LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE=1 to disable cleanup unconditionally for a session.
#
# Local branch deletion (#4100): every cleanup path — the default
# .loom/worktrees/issue-N convention, a discovered Loom-managed worktree at a
# non-standard path, and even the case where no worktree exists at all —
# attempts to delete the merged PR's local branch. Safety is determined by
# whether the local branch tip equals the merged PR's head SHA (not by `git
# branch --merged`, which is always false for a squash merge): a matching tip
# uses `git branch -D` (every commit on the branch was part of the merged PR);
# a non-matching tip (unpushed local work) falls back to `git branch -d`,
# which keeps the branch and reports it instead of force-deleting. A branch
# checked out as the current HEAD (or in another worktree) is never deleted —
# git itself refuses, and the refusal is reported with a specific message
# rather than the generic "unmerged commits" warning. The repo's default
# branch is never a delete target.
#
# Primary-checkout auto-cleanup (#5015): the one case above that is "checked
# out as the current HEAD" AND is specifically the repo's PRIMARY checkout
# (not a linked worktree) gets one extra step: if the tip-matches-head safety
# check already passed AND the primary checkout's working tree is clean with
# no stash entries (re-checked immediately before the mutating step, not
# cached), the script checks out the default branch there and force-deletes
# the branch automatically. A dirty tree, a stash entry, a tip mismatch, or
# --no-cleanup-primary all fall back to printing the manual two-step
# instructions unchanged.
#
# Override: pass --worktree-path <dir> to opt into removing a non-Loom
# worktree (the sentinel guard is bypassed only when this flag is supplied).
# Discovery: if neither the default issue-N nor pr-N worktree exists, the
# script walks `git worktree list --porcelain` looking for a worktree whose
# branch matches the merged PR's head branch. It emits a hint (not an
# auto-remove) so the operator can re-run with --worktree-path.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = merged (or auto-merge enabled)
#   1 = failed
#   3 = PR head moved past the SHA this merge attempt gated on (#5579) — a
#       session pushed new commits to the branch after the approving review
#       (or after this run's own head-SHA read). NOT a merge failure: the PR
#       is still Judge-approved, its diff just changed underneath it. Callers
#       (notably champion-pr-merge.md Step 3) must treat this distinctly from
#       exit 1 — re-queue the PR for a fresh pass rather than posting a
#       failure comment. See "Squash-merge detection trap" in that file's
#       Error Handling section for why ancestry checks can't verify this
#       state after the fact.

Loom PR Merge - Worktree-safe merge using forge API (GitHub or Gitea)

Usage: ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh <pr-number> [options]

Merges a PR via the forge API (not 'gh pr merge') to avoid
"already used by worktree" errors when merging from inside a worktree.

Supports both GitHub and Gitea forges. Forge detection is automatic
(see forge-helpers.sh for details).

Options:
  --no-cleanup-worktree  Skip local worktree AND local branch cleanup
                         after merge
  --cleanup-worktree     (no-op, worktree cleanup is now the default)
  --worktree-path <dir>  Explicit worktree path to clean up. Bypasses the
                         .loom-managed sentinel guard (caller asserts
                         responsibility — this is the documented opt-in
                         for removing non-Loom worktrees). Also deletes
                         the matching local branch via 'git branch -d'
                         (Git refuses on unmerged commits).
  --dry-run              Show what would happen without merging
  --auto                 Enable auto-merge instead of immediate merge. When the
                         repository has GitHub auto-merge disabled
                         (allow_auto_merge:false), this is detected up front and
                         degrades gracefully to wait-for-checks-then-merge
                         (immediate if already CLEAN) rather than failing (#3820).
  --allow-stacked-children
                         Bypass the pre-merge merge-ordering guard. That guard
                         hard-blocks merging a stacked PARENT PR (branch
                         feature/issue-N) while it still has open stacked CHILD
                         PRs targeting its branch, because the repo's
                         delete_branch_on_merge setting would delete the parent
                         branch synchronously during the merge and leave the
                         children unable to rebase onto it (see #3747 item 2).
                         Pass this flag only after you have manually reconciled
                         (or verified) the children — the operator asserts
                         responsibility, mirroring --worktree-path.
  --allow-unapproved     Bypass the pre-merge loom:pr review-signal guard.
                         By default the script refuses to merge (exit 1) a
                         PR whose current head does not carry the loom:pr
                         label — the only forge-visible signal Judge
                         reviewed that head (it may have been cleared by a
                         staleness guard, e.g. after a Doctor rebase). This
                         flag bypasses that block; the operator asserts
                         responsibility, mirroring --allow-stacked-children.
                         The bypass is always logged as a warning and, on a
                         real (non-dry-run) merge, best-effort recorded as a
                         PR comment audit trail too.
  --no-cleanup-primary   Skip automatic primary-checkout branch cleanup (#5015).
                         When the merged branch is checked out in the PRIMARY
                         repo checkout (not a worktree), the script normally
                         auto-checks-out the default branch and force-deletes
                         it there ONLY when provably safe (clean tree, no
                         stash entries, tip matches the merged PR head SHA).
                         Pass this to always print manual instructions instead.
  --cleanup-primary      (no-op, primary-checkout cleanup is the default)
  -h, --help             Show this help and exit

By default, the local worktree AND the local branch it held are cleaned up
after a successful merge (#4100). Pass --no-cleanup-worktree to skip both
(e.g., when other terminals may have their CWD inside the worktree, or you
want to keep a branch with unpushed commits).

Cleanup is restricted to Loom-managed worktrees (those under
.loom/worktrees/issue-N that contain a .loom-managed sentinel file written
by worktree.sh). User-provisioned worktrees at other paths are never
removed by the default code path. Set LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE=1 to disable
cleanup unconditionally for a session.

Local branch deletion (#4100): every cleanup path — including the case
where no worktree exists at all — attempts to delete the merged PR's local
branch. Safety is determined by comparing the local branch tip to the
merged PR's head SHA (not 'git branch --merged', which is always false for
a squash merge): a matching tip uses 'git branch -D'; a non-matching tip
(unpushed local work) falls back to 'git branch -d', which keeps the
branch and reports it instead of force-deleting. The branch currently
checked out (main worktree or any other) is never deleted, and the repo's
default branch is never a delete target.

Primary-checkout auto-cleanup (#5015): the one exception to "checked out
branches are never deleted" is when the branch is checked out in the repo's
PRIMARY checkout specifically (not a linked worktree) AND it is provably
safe — the tip-matches-head safety check above passed, the primary
checkout's working tree is clean, and it has no stash entries. In that case
the script checks out the default branch there and force-deletes the merged
branch automatically instead of just printing instructions. Pass
--no-cleanup-primary to always print the manual instructions instead.

When --worktree-path <dir> is passed explicitly, the operator is taking
responsibility for the cleanup decision: the sentinel guard is bypassed
for that one path. The path is validated against 'git worktree list'
and rejected if it is not a worktree of this repository.

Discovery fallback: if neither .loom/worktrees/issue-N/ nor
.loom/worktrees/pr-<PR_NUMBER>/ exists, the script walks
'git worktree list --porcelain' looking for a worktree whose branch
matches the merged PR head branch. It NEVER auto-removes a discovered
user-owned worktree; it only logs the path and suggests re-running with
--worktree-path <found-path>.

Precedence (highest wins):
  1. LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE=1     (always skip cleanup)
  2. --no-cleanup-worktree        (always skip cleanup; warns if combined
                                  with --worktree-path)
  3. --worktree-path <dir>        (explicit path; bypasses sentinel)
  4. default: .loom/worktrees/issue-N or pr-N + sentinel guard

Exit codes:
  0 = merged (or auto-merge enabled, or --help)
  1 = failed

Examples:
  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123
    Merges PR #123 (squash), deletes remote branch, cleans up worktree

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --dry-run
    Shows what would happen without merging

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --auto
    Enables auto-merge instead of merging immediately (on a repo with
    auto-merge disabled, waits for checks then merges synchronously)

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --no-cleanup-worktree
    Merges PR but leaves the local worktree in place

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --worktree-path ../adhoc-wt
    Merges PR #123 and removes the worktree at ../adhoc-wt plus its
    matching local branch (bypasses the .loom-managed sentinel guard).

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --no-cleanup-primary
    Merges PR but always prints manual instructions instead of
    auto-cleaning a branch checked out in the primary repo checkout.

  ./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh 123 --allow-unapproved
    Merges PR #123 even though it does not carry loom:pr (no forge-visible
    Judge review signal for the current head). Logs a warning and posts a
    PR comment recording the override.

# Pre-merge merge-ordering guard (#3747, stacked-PR v2 item 2).

# Runs BEFORE both the auto-merge and synchronous-merge paths (that is why it is
# defined and invoked here, above the "Merging PR" line — not next to item 1's
# POST-merge _auto_reconcile_stacked_children at the bottom of the merge flow).
#
# The race it closes: when a stacked PARENT PR (branch feature/issue-<N>)
# squash-merges, item 1's post-merge _auto_reconcile_stacked_children rebases any
# open CHILD PRs off the now-squashed parent branch onto the default branch. That
# rebase (reconcile-stack.sh's `git rebase --onto <default> <parent-branch>
# <child-branch>`) needs <parent-branch> to still resolve as a ref. But Loom's own
# recommended repo setting — delete_branch_on_merge:true, applied by
# setup-repository-settings.sh — makes GitHub delete feature/issue-<parent>
# SYNCHRONOUSLY as part of the merge API call itself, before merge-pr.sh even
# reaches the "merged successfully" log line, let alone the post-merge reconcile
# step. Once the ref is gone a fresh fetch won't see it and the rebase's <upstream>
# fails to resolve. Item 1's post-merge pass can therefore race and LOSE against
# the repo's own settings. This guard refuses to let the parent merge happen at
# all while that race exists.
#
# This is orthogonal to item 1's loom:building safe/unsafe split: a "safe" child
# is just as exposed to branch deletion as an "unsafe" one, so the guard keys
# PURELY on "does an open child PR still target this branch", never on the child's
# label. Discovery reuses item 1's live-forge-query shape (`gh pr list --base
# <parent> --state open`), NOT the ephemeral daemon registry.
#
# Default is a hard block (error, exit 1) — a normal, recoverable failure that
# Champion's cron retries next tick, exactly like every other merge-blocking
# condition in this file. --allow-stacked-children bypasses it (operator asserts
# the children are reconciled). --dry-run still runs the guard and REPORTS the

# Pre-merge defaults/ VERSION-bump collision guard (#7302).
#
# check-defaults-version-bump.sh's CI job (.github/workflows/ci.yml) gates a
# PR's own HEAD VERSION against its PR's `base.sha` — fixed at PR-open (or
# last-rebase) time and never re-diffed against the CURRENT default branch.
# When two PRs are open concurrently and both bump VERSION from the same
# stale base to the same target (e.g. both from 0.18.197 to 0.18.198), the
# first to merge advances the default branch to that target; the CI gate on
# the SECOND PR already passed against ITS OWN stale base and has no
# visibility into that concurrent merge, so it can land on top with a
# NET-ZERO version increment despite genuinely changing `defaults/` —
# silently defeating the currency signal check-defaults-version-bump.sh
# exists to guarantee (#5874). This happened for real: PR #7300 vs.
# concurrently-merged #7298.
#
# Fix shape: re-run the SAME check script — UNCHANGED, per #7302's own
# acceptance criteria; its job (diff two given refs) already works correctly,
# the gap is entirely in which refs the CI caller gives it — here, at the
# merge choke point, against the default branch's CURRENT tip instead of the
# PR's stale base.sha. That is the freshest reference available short of an
# atomic merge, and mirrors the pattern _check_no_open_stacked_children above
# already uses (a live re-check immediately before the actual merge call).
#

# failed fetch, or a PR head not reachable locally all fall through to "skip
# the check" rather than blocking a merge this guard cannot evaluate safely.

# `loom:pr` is the only forge-visible statement that the CURRENT head passed

# refuses to merge without it, but this shared script — driven directly by
# humans and in-session agents, not just Champion — previously merged
# whatever PR it was pointed at regardless of label state. That gap let a
# real incident through: a Doctor rebase cleared `loom:pr` via the staleness
# guard, and a human running this script directly moments later squash-merged
# a head no Judge had reviewed, with zero friction at the one point it was
# cheap (#7419).
#
# Default is a hard block (error, exit 1) — the same shape as
# _check_no_open_stacked_children / _check_defaults_version_bump_collision
# above — printing the CURRENT label set and head SHA so the operator can see
# exactly what they are about to merge. --allow-unapproved bypasses the
# block (operator asserts responsibility, mirroring --allow-stacked-children
# and --worktree-path); the bypass is always recorded as a loud warning
# (mirrors --allow-stacked-children's own override warning) and, on a REAL
# run only (never --dry-run — a preview must have zero forge side effects),
# best-effort recorded as a PR comment audit trail too, mirroring the
# _post_premature_close_comment / partial-increment comment pattern already
# used elsewhere in this file. --dry-run reports the would-be block without
# exiting 1 or merging, same dry-run contract as both guards above.
#

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Partial-increment closing-keyword conflict detection (#4569, extended by
# #4595 to cover commit messages).
#
# ROOT CAUSE (established from the rjwalters/censusapi#5 -> censusapi#2 incident,
# NOT from the branch-name theory the report floated):
#
#   GitHub's closing-reference parser scans the ENTIRE PR body and honors ANY
#   `close|closes|closed|fix|fixes|fixed|resolve|resolves|resolved` that is
#   IMMEDIATELY followed by `#N` — wherever it appears, including buried in
#   prose, inside a list item, or mid-sentence. It is NOT limited to a
#   line-leading trailer.
#
#   censusapi PR #5 ended with the deliberate non-closing trailer
#   `Contributes to #2`, but an earlier "Operator follow-up (after merge)" step
#   read "...then close #2". GitHub honored that `close #2` as a real closing
#   reference and closed issue #2 on squash-merge, silently defeating the #3599
#   partial-increment convention. The evidence:
#     - issue #2's timeline has NO `connected` event, so there was no
#       Development-sidebar / branch-name link -> the `feature/issue-N`
#       branch-name auto-link hypothesis is RULED OUT;
#     - the squash commit message contained only `Contributes to #2` (no closing
#       keyword), so the close did not come from the commit message either;
#     - the `closed` event has `commit_id: null` with the merger as actor at the
#       merge instant — the signature of a PR-body closing-reference close.
#
# SECOND SOURCE (#4595): the same parser also runs over the SQUASH COMMIT
#   MESSAGE. forge_merge_pr() squash-merges with no commit_title/commit_message
#   override, so GitHub composes that message from the PR's own commit messages —
#   a stray `close #N` in any commit message closes #N on merge even when the PR
#   body only ever says `Part of #N`. That close is fully attributable (the
#   `closed` event carries the merge `commit_id`), it is just invisible to both
#   the body regex and `closingIssuesReferences`, so the commit messages are
#   consulted as a third signal below.
#
# Fix shape: DETECT (here, pre-merge, with a loud actionable warning) plus
# SELF-HEAL (post-merge reopen in _reset_one_partial_issue below). Prevention by
# rewriting the PR body at merge time was rejected — mutating a body the Judge
# already reviewed is a worse failure mode than a seconds-long close/reopen.
#
# Two globals are published for the post-merge pass, both space-separated:
#   PARTIAL_OPEN_BEFORE_MERGE - partial-increment refs that were OPEN right
#       before the merge (so "closed afterwards" is attributable to this merge).
#   PARTIAL_CONFLICT_ISSUES   - the subset that ALSO carries a closing reference
#       from this PR, i.e. the ones GitHub is about to close against the
#       declared intent. Only these are auto-reopened; that keeps a deliberate
#       human close inside the merge window (which carries no closing reference)
#       from being reverted.

# (#5234): a bare `grep` over the whole text also matched a mid-sentence,
# backticked, conditional mention like "...say so and I will switch the
# reference to `Part of #4574`" — prose describing a hypothetical, not a
# declared intent — and treated it as authoritative, reopening a correctly
# closed issue. To count as a declaration here the keyword must be
# line-leading, optionally preceded by a list marker (`-`/`*`/`+`/numbered
# `1.`/blockquote `>`) and/or whitespace — matching the actual shape this
# convention produces (a one-line `Part of #123` / `Contributes to #456`
# trailer, per builder-pr.md), not prose that merely references the pattern.
#
# Fenced code blocks are stripped first, then inline code spans (`` `...` ``)
# are blanked so a backticked mention cannot itself satisfy the line-leading

#
# The second stage extracts `#N` tokens FIRST and only then strips the `#`.
# Scanning the whole matched span for any digit run would also pick up the

# which is exactly the false-positive-reopen class this guard exists to
# prevent: a body carrying both `3. Part of #789` and a genuine `Closes #3`

# leaves `loom:building` orphaned on it: the #2838 "skip label cleanup on close"
# decision only reasoned about the `Closes #N` auto-close case, where GitHub
# closes the issue and stale labels on closed items are harmless. Nothing else
# reclaims the label until a time-gated `/sweep all` stale-claim pass (>=2h),
# and non-aggressive sweeps hard-skip the still-`loom:building` issue
# indefinitely (issue #3667).
#
# Here — at the deterministic merge choke point — we swap each such still-open,

# loom:issue, i.e. return to the ready queue). No liveness check is needed: a

PR #$PR_NUMBER referenced this issue with a **non-closing** \`Part of\` / \`Contributes to\` keyword — a declared partial increment, so this issue was meant to stay **open** after the merge. GitHub closed it anyway, because a **closing keyword** (\`close\`/\`fix\`/\`resolve\` and their tense variants) immediately followed by \`#$issue_num\` appeared elsewhere in the PR — in the body, or in one of the PR's commit messages (this merge squashes without overriding the commit message, so GitHub composes the squash message from those commits).

GitHub honors a closing keyword **anywhere** in a PR body or squash commit message — not only in a line-leading trailer — so prose like \"…then close #$issue_num\" in a follow-up checklist, or a stray \`close #$issue_num\` in a commit message, creates a real closing link that overrides the intended \`Contributes to #$issue_num\`.

**Action taken**: reopened this issue.

**To avoid this**: never put a closing keyword immediately before \`#$issue_num\` anywhere in a partial-increment PR's body **or commit messages**. Write \`close the issue\` or \`close issue #$issue_num\` instead of \`close #$issue_num\`.

# Closed-issue `loom:building` cleanup (#6199).
#
# The #2838 "no label cleanup on close" decision reasoned that a stale label
# on a closed issue is harmless — every queue query filters on open state, so
# it can never cause a duplicate build or a blocked candidate. That is still
# true. What #6199 found is that the decision also has a real, if narrow,
# cost: any consumer that reasonably reads `loom:building` as "in flight"
# WITHOUT also filtering on state — a dashboard, a capacity check, an
# operator `gh issue list --label loom:building` spot-check, or a future tool
# — gets pure noise once the population of closed-but-still-labelled issues
# grows (observed: 20 stale claims on one consumer repo, 0 real ones). The
# label has stopped meaning what its name says for anyone who doesn't already
# know to filter it out.
#
# Scope decision (recorded here per #6199's own "worth deciding deliberately"
# note): this pass covers ONLY the merge-driven auto-close path (`Closes #N`
# / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N`, resolved the same way Champion's "Verify
# Issue Auto-Close" step does — via GitHub's GraphQL
# `closingIssuesReferences`, see forge_pr_close_targets above) — the
# deterministic case merge-pr.sh already owns and can act on right at the
# confirmed-merge choke point, with zero extra liveness/state ambiguity: a
# merge just happened on the PR that closed the issue, so the label is
# unconditionally stale. An issue closed OUTSIDE a merge (closed manually, as
# a duplicate, or `--reason "not planned"` by an autonomous role) is
# deliberately OUT OF SCOPE here — merge-pr.sh has no hook into that path at
# all, and inventing one (e.g. polling every issue close event) is
# disproportionate to a cosmetic-but-annoying defect. That population is
# instead handled by the standalone, idempotent
# `clean-stale-building-labels.sh` (same directory) — run once against this
# repo as part of #6199 to clear the accumulated backlog, and safe to re-run
# on demand (by an operator, or wired into a periodic role) for any future
# manual-close stragglers. See that script's header for the full rationale.
#
# Runs AFTER _reset_partial_increment_labels (and therefore after any #4569
# premature-auto-close revert) so an issue that pass just reopened is no
# longer `closed` by the time this pass reads it — reopened partial-increment
# issues must keep `loom:building` (they return to `loom:issue` instead, via
# that pass), never lose the label outright.
#
# GitHub-only for v1 (guarded on FORGE_TYPE), mirroring
# _reset_partial_increment_labels's gating — forge_gh_remove_label_rl_safe is
# a `gh`-specific helper. Every step is best-effort and must never fail the
# merge.

# Automated stacked-PR reconciliation on parent merge (#3747, stacked-PR v2,
# item 1 of the v2 epic — the remaining five items stay deferred).
#
# When a stacked PARENT PR (branch feature/issue-<N>) squash-merges, any CHILD
# PRs based on the parent branch still carry the parent's now-squashed pre-merge
# commits. reconcile-stack.sh performs the git surgery — `git rebase --onto
# <default> <parent-branch> <child-branch>`, `push --force-with-lease`, retarget
# the child PR base to the default branch — that strips them. v1 (#3729) shipped
# reconcile-stack.sh as a STANDALONE, operator-invoked script and deliberately
# left merge-pr.sh untouched. This v2 slice fires it AUTOMATICALLY here — a
# best-effort, GitHub-only step gated so it never races a live Builder that still
# holds the child branch checked out.
#
# Discovery is via a LIVE forge query (`gh pr list --base <parent>`), NOT the
# ephemeral loom-daemon SweepRegistry: terminal registry entries are
# garbage-collected ~1h after transition and the registry only exists at all when
# loom-daemon is running, but this function may run from Champion's cron or an
# interactive /loom:sweep merge with no daemon present (see
# .loom/docs/daemon-reference.md → "Stacked-PR dependency").
#
# Safe/unsafe split per child, gated on the child ISSUE's loom:building label
# (fresh, uncached `gh api` read, mirroring _reset_one_partial_issue's freshness
# discipline):
#   - Safe   (child issue NOT loom:building): no live claim on the child, so
#            invoke reconcile-stack.sh directly.
#   - Unsafe (child issue still loom:building): a live Builder likely has the
#            child branch checked out in its own worktree; an out-of-band rebase
#            + force-with-lease would corrupt its in-progress work. Skip the
#            auto-rebase and post a comment noting reconciliation is deferred
#            until the Builder finishes (a later parent-merge-triggered pass, or
#            a manual reconcile-stack.sh run, picks it up).
#
# Idempotent by construction: once a child's base is retargeted away from the
# parent branch, `gh pr list --base <parent>` returns zero rows, so re-runs are
# no-ops and nothing double-fires.
#
# Every step is best-effort and must NEVER change merge-pr.sh's exit code — the
# parent merge already happened. Runs BEFORE branch deletion so the parent
# branch ref still resolves as reconcile-stack.sh's rebase <upstream> argument.

# Stale-cached-mergeable recheck before refusal (#6104).
#
# GitHub's REST `.mergeable` field is computed asynchronously and invalidated
# on every push to the base branch. On a repo with continuous automated
# merges it can read a stale `false` shortly after a base-branch push even
# though the branch would merge cleanly against current main. The gate at
# the synchronous-merge callsite previously trusted the first `.mergeable`
# read and refused immediately, asserting a conflict that did not actually
# exist.
#
# This function, called only once `.mergeable` has already read `false`:
#   1. Re-queries PR state via the UNCACHED recheck path
#      (forge_get_pr_nocache) after a short backoff, up to `retries` times.
#      Uses the uncached path deliberately — $GH may be wrapped by
#      `gh-cached` (see merge-pr.sh's $GH setup), and re-reading through that
#      cache would keep returning the same stale value, defeating the
#      backoff entirely (mirrors the existing _NRC_RECHECK_JSON pattern).
#   2. If still `false` after all retries, corroborates with a local
#      `git merge-tree` check against the freshly fetched base ref — this is
#      what lets the caller distinguish "the forge's cached state is
#      stale/unknown" from "this branch genuinely conflicts" (a real
#      conflict will also fail `git merge-tree`).
#
# Usage:
#   _recheck_mergeable_before_refusal NWO PR_NUMBER GH_CMD BASE_REF HEAD_REF REPO_ROOT [RETRIES] [DELAY]
#
# Echoes exactly one "<action>:<reason>" line on stdout, always returns 0 (the
# decision is conveyed via stdout, not exit status, so callers under
# `set -e` can safely capture it with `$(...)`):
#   merge:<reason>            - proceed with the merge (recheck succeeded, or
#                                merge-tree independently confirms clean).
#   refuse-conflict:<reason>  - refuse; local git merge-tree independently
#                                confirms a real conflict.
#   refuse-stale:<reason>     - refuse; the forge's cached state never
#                                resolved to true, and local corroboration was
#                                unavailable (missing refs, fetch failure) —

# Repo-level "Allow auto-merge" disabled — proactive wait-then-merge (#3820).
#
# When the repository's GitHub "Allow auto-merge" setting is OFF
# (`gh api repos/{nwo} --jq .allow_auto_merge` == false), the server-side
# auto-merge queue can NEVER be enabled — enablePullRequestAutoMerge is rejected
# regardless of PR state. The reactive #3763 fallback catches that post-mutation
# rejection, but only degrades gracefully when the PR is ALREADY immediately
# mergeable; when auto-merge is disabled AND the PR is not yet CLEAN (checks
# still running / .mergeable not yet computed), #3763's mergeability recheck sees
# `.mergeable != true` and preserves the terminal error, so the PR never merges
# (the reported failure on a repo with allow_auto_merge:false).
#
# This function is entered PROACTIVELY from the repo-setting probe below (so we
# never attempt the doomed mutation at all) and degrades `--auto` to
# "wait-for-checks-then-merge, or immediate merge if already CLEAN": it polls the
# head-SHA check-runs (bounded by LOOM_AUTO_MERGE_TIMEOUT, same knobs as the
# UNSTABLE fallback) until they settle, then returns 0 so the caller flips to the
# synchronous-merge path. Unlike the UNSTABLE branch it also handles the
# already-CLEAN case (nothing failing, nothing pending) by returning 0 for an
# immediate merge rather than hitting that branch's defensive "unknown gap" error.
#
# Contract:
#   - returns 0  → safe to proceed to the synchronous-merge path (caller flips
#                  AUTO_MERGE=false). Also returned if the PR merged concurrently
#                  while waiting (the synchronous path's own race-detection then
#                  no-ops cleanly).
#   - calls error() (exit 1) → a required status check failed, or the wait timed
#                  out. A normal recoverable failure Champion's cron retries.

#
# EXCEPTION 2 (#6199): `loom:building` specifically — unlike other labels — is
# read by some consumers (dashboards, capacity checks, manual spot-checks) as
# meaning "in flight" WITHOUT also filtering on issue state, so a stale claim
# left on a just-closed issue silently becomes noise rather than staying truly
# harmless. The _strip_closed_issue_building_labels call above removes it from
# each issue THIS merge closed (via `Closes`/`Fixes`/`Resolves`). #2838's core
# reasoning — "don't bother cleaning up labels on close" — still holds for
# every other label, and for issues closed by means other than a merge (see
# that function's header for the recorded scope decision).

# "Verify Issue Auto-Close" step is a belt-and-suspenders check that uses
# `forge_pr_close_targets` (which delegates to GitHub's GraphQL

# Cleanup worktree if requested.
#
# Ownership model (see issue #3334): Loom owns worktrees it created under
# .loom/worktrees/ (marked with a .loom-managed sentinel file by worktree.sh
# or pr-worktree.sh). Any worktree lacking the sentinel is treated as
# user-owned and is never removed by this script. Operators can also set
# LOOM_PRESERVE_WORKTREE=1 to skip cleanup unconditionally.
#
# Two worktree-path conventions are recognized:
#   - .loom/worktrees/issue-<N>/  (Loom-issue branches: feature/issue-<N>;
#     the Builder's worktree)
#   - .loom/worktrees/pr-<N>/     (external-fork / ad-hoc branches, #3358;
#     OR a Judge/Doctor review worktree for an ordinary feature/issue-<N>
#     branch created via pr-worktree.sh when no builder issue-<N> worktree
#     was present at review time, #6264)
#
# A pr-<N> worktree of the LATTER shape can exist ALONGSIDE an issue-<N>
# worktree for the same PR (the builder worktree is created/reused after the
# Judge's pr-<N> review worktree, or vice versa) — the merge-time cleanup
# below checks for both when PR_BRANCH matches feature/issue-<N>, not just
# the issue-<N> path (#6264: previously only the external-fork branch ever
# considered a pr-<N> path, so a co-existing Judge review worktree on an
# ordinary issue branch was never cleaned up and survived the merge).
#
# Branch-to-issue regex is the strict `^feature/issue-([0-9]+)$` pattern so
# branches like `release-1` or `fix-bug-42` correctly classify as PR-style
# (not issue-style) and clean up the right worktree.

  # (feature/issue-<N>) — the worktree.sh naming convention makes that name
  # collide deterministically whenever two hosts/sessions independently claim
  # the same issue number. When a *different*, still-live builder has that
  # branch checked out with unsaved edits, the blanket `git worktree remove
  # --force` below would silently destroy them (observed 2026-08-03 on #5001:
  # a live sibling session lost its in-flight, never-committed edits). The
  # neighbouring guards check only *identity/ownership* (primary-worktree #3710,
  # .loom-managed sentinel), never *live content*, so none of them catch this.
  # Refuse-and-warn instead: the merge itself already succeeded, so skipping
  # cleanup is a safe no-op for the merge while the sibling's work survives on
  # disk to be committed/pushed. The clean common case is unaffected — a
  # worktree that already committed+pushed the merged PR reports no changes, and
  # Loom's own gitignored runtime markers (.loom-managed / .loom-in-use /
  # .loom-checkpoint / .no-changes-needed / .snapshots/) are filtered out so a
  # bare/stale checkout that surfaces them as untracked is still removed.
  #
  # Not to be re-conflated in triage (distinct root causes):
  #   - #4463 (closed): same-HOST duplicate dispatch — fixed lock *ownership* so
  #     a live sweep's lock is not stolen by a peer's reaper. That is about lock
  #     records, not worktree/branch-name collision, and would not have caught
  #     #5031 (the colliding worktree came from a separate host that never
  #     touched this daemon's lock).

# increment lifecycle (#3667): a `Part of #N` / `Contributes to #N` PR merges
# while issue N stays open, and the next Builder increment (or an agent still
# inside it) needs that worktree. But naively querying the issue's LIVE state
# right after merge has a race: GitHub closes `Closes #N` issues
# ASYNCHRONOUSLY, after the merge webhook fires — so a lookup taken here
# would see "open" for essentially every normal merge and silently defeat
# cleanup entirely. Gate the live lookup on whether this PR is actually a
# close target of the issue:
#
#   - $issue_number IS a close target of $PR_NUMBER -> the merge itself
#     closes it; clean up exactly as before this change (no lookup, no
#     race).
#   - $issue_number is NOT a close target (partial increment, or no closing
#     keyword at all) -> query live state via forge_get_issue_state and
#     preserve the worktree unless that state is CLOSED.
#
# Fail-unsafe-to-preserve: any lookup failure (forge_pr_close_targets
# returning nothing, forge_get_issue_state failing / returning an unknown
