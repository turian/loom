# guard-destructive-generic.sh - VENDORED copy of Repo Skills' generic guard.
#
# ============================================================================
# VENDORED COPY — the canonical home of this generic destructive-command guard
# is Repo Skills (https://github.com/rjwalters/repo →
# hooks/repo/guard-destructive.sh, installed into consumer repos at
# .claude/skills/repo/hooks/guard-destructive.sh). This file is a clearly-marked
# vendored copy shipped by Loom ONLY so that standalone-Loom repos (no Repo
# Skills installed) keep full destructive-command coverage. See issue #4041.
#
# It is NEVER run directly in a repo that has the canonical Repo Skills guard:
# the guard-destructive.sh DISPATCHER (in this same directory) prefers the
# canonical guard when it is present and carries the rjwalters/repo#29 fix, and
# only falls back to this vendored copy otherwise. Loom's installer / resync
# likewise skips installing this file entirely when the canonical guard is
# present.
#
# DO NOT hand-edit generic pattern behavior here — send fixes upstream to
# Repo Skills so the canonical copy (and every consumer of it) benefits. Loom
# re-vendors this file from the upstream canonical guard at release time.

#
# Claude Code PreToolUse hook that intercepts Bash commands before execution.
# Receives JSON on stdin with tool_input.command and cwd fields.
#
# IMPORTANT: This hook only fires when Claude Code is invoked with:
#   --dangerously-skip-permissions  ← hooks FIRE (used by Loom agents)
#
# It does NOT fire with:
#   --permission-mode bypassPermissions  ← hooks SKIPPED entirely
#
# If you have a shell alias like 'alias claude="claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions"',
# this safety hook will be silently disabled in interactive sessions.
# Use --dangerously-skip-permissions instead for automation that needs hooks.
#
# Decisions:
#   - Block (deny): Dangerous commands that should never run
#   - Ask: Commands that need human confirmation
#   - Allow: Everything else (exit 0, no output)
#
# Output format (Claude Code hooks spec):
#   { "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "permissionDecision": "deny|ask", "permissionDecisionReason": "..." } }
#
# NOTE: The "hookEventName": "PreToolUse" field is REQUIRED by Claude Code's
# PreToolUse hook schema. Without it, Claude Code silently discards the
# decision and the guard becomes inert (see issue #3550).
#
# Error handling: This script MUST never exit with a non-zero code or produce
# invalid output. Any internal error is caught by the trap, logged for
# diagnostics, and results in an "allow" decision to prevent infinite retry
# loops in Claude Code.

# Determine log directory relative to this script's location

# (.loom/hooks/), so this resolves to .loom/logs/guard-decisions.log in a real
# install. LOOM_GUARD_DECISION_LOG_FILE overrides the path (a test seam; also
# lets an operator point the log elsewhere). Off by default — see

# DECISION TELEMETRY (issue #3771) — one JSONL record per deny/ask decision.
#
# Append a machine-readable record to DECISION_LOG each time the guard denies or
# asks, so false-positive friction becomes measurable (which patterns fire, how
# often, before/after a precision fix). Deliberately does NOT log `allow`: the
# #3687 read-only fast path's zero-overhead silent-allow must stay silent, and
# allow-logging would swamp the log with the ~99% common case.
#
# STABLE SCHEMA (the contract #3772's reader/aggregation tooling stacks on — do
# NOT rename fields without considering that dependency), one JSON object per
# line:
#   {"ts":"<UTC>","decision":"deny"|"ask","pattern":"<tag>",
#    "tier":"catastrophic"|"ask","command":"<redacted>"}
#     ts       — UTC timestamp, same format as log_hook_error's date -u call.
#     decision — "deny" or "ask".
#     pattern  — a short, stable rule tag (NOT the full free-text reason). For
#                the pattern-array loops it is the matched pattern; the non-loop
#                sites pass a static tag (e.g. "sql-ddl", "rm-protected-path").
#     tier     — "catastrophic" for deny, "ask" for ask.
#     command  — the command string, REDACTED via strip_literal_text() so no raw
#                --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment secret value is persisted.
#
# Best-effort like log_hook_error: gated by the lazy decision_log_enabled()
# toggle, and a log-write failure (permission denied, disk full, missing dir)
# NEVER changes the deny/ask decision and NEVER causes a non-zero exit. Callers
# invoke it as `log_guard_decision ... || true` so it can never trip the ERR
# trap.
#
# One-liner to summarize fires by pattern (AC — full tooling is #3772):
#   jq -r '.pattern' .loom/logs/guard-decisions.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# READ-ONLY FAST PATH (issue #3687) — default ON.
#
# guard-destructive.sh is a PreToolUse/Bash hook, so it fires before EVERY Bash
# tool call. In Bash-dense sessions (remote ops, benchmark drivers) the vast
# majority of those calls are obviously read-only — `git status`, `ls`, `grep`,
# `aws … describe*`, `gh … list` — yet each one still runs the full deny/ask
# gauntlet (~37 grep/awk/sed forks + a git rev-parse, ~179ms measured). This
# block short-circuits that overwhelmingly-common case to a silent `allow` with
# a single bash-builtin structural test (zero forks) plus, only when that test
# passes, one lazy `jq` config read.
#
# SECURITY: a fast path is a guard bypass by construction, so admission is
# purely STRUCTURAL and conservative — never content-sensitive:
#   1. Reject fast-path eligibility if the raw command contains ANY of
#      ;  &  |  <  >  backtick  $(  or a newline. This kills chaining, piping,
#      redirection, and command substitution (so `git status && <force-push>`,
#      `git status; rm -rf /`, `git status $(rm -rf /)`, `git status > /etc/x`
#      all fall through to the full path unchanged).
#   2. Exact first-token (command-word) allowlist — never a wrapper. Because the
#      allowlist is keyed on the literal first token, wrapper forms (`bash -c`,
#      `sh -c`, `eval`, `xargs`, `env … git status`, `sudo git status`) are
#      excluded automatically: their first token isn't allowlisted.
#   3. Verb/subcommand exactness for multi-word tools, chosen to be provably
#      disjoint from every existing deny/ask pattern:
#        git status|log|diff|show  (bare — `git -C /p status` is NOT admitted)
#        ls  grep  rg
#        jq  wc  head  tail        (pure read-only text/JSON filters — none has
#          an in-place-mutation flag, so any args are admitted, #3772)
#        echo                      (pure stdout writer — never treats its
#          arguments as executable code, has no mutation flag, and any command
#          it might otherwise smuggle to a downstream interpreter needs a pipe
#          or redirect, both already killed by the structural test above, so
#          `echo "<anything>"` alone is safe to admit unconditionally, #5838)
#        test  [  [[               (boolean file/string test builtins — no
#          mutation surface at all, #3772)
#        find                      (admitted for any args EXCEPT when a dangerous
#          action-primary is present: -delete, -exec, -execdir, -ok, -okdir,
#          -fls, -fprint, -fprint0, -fprintf. Any of those disqualifies eligibility
#          and falls through to the full path — structural, not content-scanned,
#          so a future `find -delete` deny rule is never silently bypassed, #3772)
#        gh <noun> view|list       (never delete/close/archive/…)
#        aws <service> describe*|get*|list*  and  aws s3 ls   (mirrors the
#          verb-anchoring already in CLOUD_ASK_PATTERNS: those verbs are never
#          mutating, so this only skips greps that were going to allow anyway)
#   cat and ssh are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED from the built-in list:
#     - cat has a narrow existing ASK carve-out (cat …/.ssh/, cat …/.aws/
#       credentials); a blanket cat fast-path would silently skip it.
#     - ssh wraps an OPAQUE remote command string that the raw ALWAYS_BLOCK scan
#       still covers today; fast-pathing any `ssh …` would drop that coverage.
#
# False NEGATIVES (declining eligibility) are always safe — they just fall
# through to the correct, slower existing behavior. False POSITIVES are the only
# danger, so the eligibility test stays maximally conservative.
#
# CONFIG-ORDERING CHOICE: this block runs BEFORE REPO_ROOT is resolved (the git
# rev-parse subprocess below), on purpose — the structural test never needs the
# repo root. Only the toggle/extra-list config read needs a config file, and it
# is resolved LAZILY (only after structural admission already passed) by walking
# up from CWD to the nearest Loom config root WITHOUT forking git
# (fastpath_config_root). So a fast-pathed command pays: 1 bash-builtin test +
# (only if eligible) 1 stat-walk + up to 2 bounded jq reads (project tier, then
# legacy tier only if the key is absent from project) — never the git
# rev-parse, never a deny/ask array, never a log write.
#
# Toggle: guards.readOnlyFastPath (default true) / LOOM_GUARD_READONLY_FASTPATH
# env (0/false/no disables, 1/true/yes forces on; env wins). Optional
# guards.readOnlyFastPathExtra is an EXTEND-ONLY array of literal first-word
# commands (each entry is a full-generality bypass for that command word), minus
# the reserved words the escape hatch may not claim (#4791 — see
# _fastpath_extra_reserved below: no denial-floor command word, no shell/exec
# wrapper, so no .loom/config.json can fast-path past the ungated floor).
# =============================================================================

# CARVE-OUT (#4063, UPDATED for Epic #3835 Phase 5, #4262): the fast-path
# config readers below — fastpath_config_root, _fastpath_tiered_get,
# _fastpath_tiered_get_array, fastpath_enabled, fastpath_extra_admits — are
# deliberately NOT migrated to the shared config-resolver.sh (loom_config_get /
# loom_resolve_config) that the cold-path toggles use. This is intentional and
# preserves issue #3687's fork budget:
#   * This block can `exit 0` (silent allow) BEFORE REPO_ROOT is resolved — the
#     `git -C "$CWD" rev-parse --show-toplevel` fork lives strictly below the
#     fast-path dispatch. loom_resolve_config REQUIRES a repo_root as its first
#     argument, so routing these through it would force hoisting that git
#     rev-parse above the fast-path exit, directly regressing #3687 (which
#     removed it from the pre-admission path).
#   * fastpath_config_root is a fork-free bash-builtin upward directory walk
#     (now stat-ing for EITHER `.loom-project/project.json` or
#     `.loom/config.json`, so a `.loom-project/`-only repo is still found);
#     fastpath_enabled / fastpath_extra_admits each cost AT MOST two CACHED,
#     file-scoped jq reads (project tier, then legacy tier ONLY when the key
#     is absent from the project tier — #4262's Epic #3835 `.loom-project/`
#     tier reaching this toggle without forking the full merge).
#     loom_resolve_config is uncached and soft-reads every tier file plus a
#     merge (4+ forks today) on EVERY call — a 4x+ regression on a hook that
#     fires before every Bash tool call. Caching the merge (Option B) still
#     needs a repo_root, and teaching the resolver a fork-free upward-walk
#     root discovery (Option C) would break the documented three-language
#     (Rust/Python/Bash) conformance-fixture contract in config-resolver.sh's
#     header. So the fast path keeps its direct, bounded (<=2 fork) reads
#     instead. See #4063 for the original analysis and #4262 for the tier
#     widening.
#
# Locate the nearest Loom config ROOT by walking up from CWD, fork-free (no
# git rev-parse) — a directory holding EITHER the tracked project tier
# (.loom-project/project.json, Epic #3835) OR the legacy tier
# (.loom/config.json). Cached. Best-effort: empty when neither is found.
#
# Epic #3835 Phase 5 (#4262): previously this walked looking for
# .loom/config.json alone. Widening the stat to "either tier file" keeps the
# walk itself fork-free (bash-builtin [[ -f ]] tests only) while letting the
# two readers below (fastpath_enabled / fastpath_extra_admits) consult
# .loom-project/project.json — see the CARVE-OUT comment above for why this
# stays a direct, bounded-fork jq read instead of routing through
# loom_resolve_config().

# Read-only search-pipe-to-sink admission (#5263). Pure bash builtins, zero forks.
#
# The shared fastpath_structural_ok() above disqualifies EVERY pipe, which is
# correct for the general case but produces a self-defeating false positive for
# the single most common interactive idiom: piping a read-only search to a pager
# or counter. `grep 'DROP TABLE' schema.sql | head` is 100% read-only — the DDL
# phrase lives only inside grep's quoted search argument, and grep never executes
# what it matches — yet the pipe kicked it to the full path, where SQL_DDL_PATTERN
# (:~2819) substring-matches the literal phrase in grep's own argument and denies
# at the catastrophic tier. The bare `grep 'DROP TABLE' schema.sql` (no pipe) was
# already fast-pathed and allowed; this narrows the gap so the piped form matches.
#
# SECURITY: this is a deliberately NARROW carve-out, not a general "pipes are OK"
# relaxation. It admits ONLY the shape
#     <search> | <read-only-sink>
# where:
#   * exactly ONE pipe, and NO other shell metacharacter (; & < > ` $( newline)
#     anywhere — so wrapper (`bash -c`), substitution (`$(...)`), and compound
#     (`&&`/`;`) forms are untouched and keep denying via the full path exactly
#     as before (satisfying #5263's "obfuscation still caught" requirement);
#   * the UPSTREAM command word is a non-executing search: grep|egrep|fgrep|rg
#     (grep/rg are already fully admitted for any args by the built-in allowlist;
#     egrep/fgrep are the same tool). A real DDL-executing command piped the same
#     way (`mysql -e '…' | cat`, `psql -c '…' | head`) has a non-search first
#     token, so it is NOT admitted and still denies;
#   * the DOWNSTREAM command word is a fixed read-only sink allowlist. head|tail|wc
#     are already fully allowlisted (any args), so they admit with any args. cat,
#     less, and more are NOT in the built-in allowlist — cat has a live `.ssh`/
#     `.aws/credentials` ASK carve-out (:~3764) — so they admit ONLY as pure stdin
#     consumers (no positional file operand). This keeps `grep x | cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
#     (which would leak a key past the cat ASK) OUT of the fast path: it falls
#     through to the full path where the cat ASK still fires.
#
# False NEGATIVES (declining) are always safe — they just fall through to the
# existing slower behavior. So anything not matching the exact shape above (a
# second pipe, an unlisted sink, a non-search upstream, a cat/less/more with a
# file operand) declines and is handled by the full path unchanged.

# Quote/escape-aware pipe count (#5673). Pure bash string ops, zero forks —
# same budget as fastpath_grep_pipe_admits() itself.
#
# A `|` that lives inside a single-/double-quoted argument (grep's own BRE
# alternation pattern, e.g. `"DROP TABLE\|SQL_DDL_PATTERN"`) or immediately
# after an unquoted backslash escape is DATA to the shell, not a pipe
# operator. The naive whole-string character count fastpath_grep_pipe_admits()
# used to do (`${cmd%%|*}` / `case "$right" in *'|'*)`) could not tell that
# apart from a real second pipe: it split at the quoted `|` first, then saw
# the genuine trailing `| head` as a "second" pipe and declined — falling
# through to the full pattern-matching path, which then denied on a bare
# substring match (e.g. "DROP TABLE") inside what was actually a read-only
# grep search argument. This mirrors the quote-tracking state machine
# qsplit() (:~1295) already uses for the awk-side segment splitters (#3755),
# ported to bash since this fast path must stay fork-free; by this point in
# fastpath_grep_pipe_admits(), the caller has already rejected any `$(` /
# backtick anywhere in $cmd, so — unlike qsplit() — a quoted span here can
# never smuggle a command substitution and needs no such carve-out.

# OFF by default: it writes a new persistent, cross-session artifact of redacted
# commands, so — mirroring the other opt-in data-collection features in Loom
# (transcript archival #3726, the model-cost experiment #3725) — a zero-config
# install sees NO new file and NO behaviour change. An operator enables it to
# measure guard-hook friction.
#
# Same INVERSE polarity as reversible_gh_guard_enabled(): defaults false, the
# absent-key resolution is false, and only an explicit `true` (config) or a
# truthy env value enables it.

# As of issue #3628 (ADR Option B) this guard defaults to `repo` mode: it
# DENIES any rm target that is neither under the repo / worktree areas nor on a
# built-in ephemeral allowlist (system temp dirs + the Claude scratchpad), in
# addition to the catastrophic top-level deny. A zero-config install therefore
# gets outside-repo rm protection out of the box (e.g. `rm -rf
# /Users/someone/important` is DENIED).
#
# The legacy permissive behaviour — block only catastrophic rm targets (root,
# $HOME, bare top-level dirs) and ALLOW every deeper subpath including subpaths
# OUTSIDE the repo — is now an explicit opt-out: guards.rmScope:"off" (or the
# synonym "permissive") / LOOM_RM_SCOPE=off. Consumers who relied on the old
# permissive default must set one of those to restore it.
#
# The catastrophic top-level deny stays unconditional in BOTH modes, so bare

#   1. LOOM_RM_SCOPE env var (repo enables; off/0/no/permissive disables).

# worktree-isolation toggle — Bash-tool write confinement (issue #4178).
#
# guard-worktree-paths.sh confines the Edit/Write TOOL matcher to a builder's
# issue worktree, but nothing confined the Bash tool: `>`/`>>` redirection,
# `tee`, `sed -i`, `cp`/`mv` all write files without ever going through
# Edit/Write, so a session denied on Edit/Write could fall back to Bash and
# land the same write in the main checkout. Sweep #4063 used exactly this
# escape to edit live guard hooks in the main checkout while its own worktree
# stayed clean (see the issue's root-cause writeup / hook-error-log timeline).
#
# This reuses the SAME toggle guard-worktree-paths.sh already exposes
# (guards.worktreeIsolation / LOOM_GUARD_WORKTREE_ISOLATION) — one switch, not
# two — so a repo/session that already opted out of Edit/Write confinement
# gets the identical Bash-write confinement decision, and the documented
# escape hatch (a human/driver session that must edit the main checkout while
# worktrees exist) keeps working here too.
#
# Resolution order (highest precedence first), mirroring every other guard
# toggle in this file:

#     not `refs/stash`), so blocking them strands work with no recovery path.
#   - `apply` / `list` / `show` / `branch` — do not remove entries from the
#     shared stack.
#   - `create` / `store` — plumbing. `git stash create` is exactly what
#     worktree.sh's own `stash-push` runs, so matching it would deny the
#     sanctioned replacement path itself.
#   - `-h` / `--help` — not an operation at all.

# ERE has no lookahead, and one command can chain several `git stash`
# invocations of different kinds (`git stash && <check>; git stash pop` is the

# anchor entirely, and even after that half is fixed, an unfixed subcommand
# class would swallow the closing backtick into the token itself (`push\``)

# bare or DOUBLE-quoted `$` is an expansion the guard cannot resolve.
#
# Emits (in the global _MARKED_TOKEN) the token with:
#   - quote characters removed (so `"$A"/x`, `"$A/x"` and `$A/x` all normalize
#     to the same shape and quoting cannot be used to dodge the shape tests),

# From a LINKED-WORKTREE cwd — the canonical builder setup — that fabrication
# walks straight back into the acting worktree's own `.loom-managed` sentinel

# via ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS for the explicit main/master forms.
#
# guards.forceScope selects the behaviour:
#   "all"       (default) — ask on every force op, exactly as before (#3674).
#   "protected"           — ask only when the resolved target is a protected
#                           branch (repo default / main / master) or the branch
#                           identity is ambiguous (detached HEAD); allow force
#                           ops on the agent's own working branches.
#   "off"                 — never ask/deny on force ops. The unconditional
#                           main/master hard-denies in ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS
#                           STILL apply in every mode, including "off".

# Resolution order (highest precedence first):
#   1. LOOM_FORCE_SCOPE env var (all/protected/off). Overrides config.
#   2. .loom/config.json  ->  guards.forceScope: "protected"/"off"; absent key /
#      any other value / malformed JSON => "all" (the current-behaviour default).
#   3. Default: all (preserve current behaviour byte-for-byte)
#
# Mirrors sql_guard_enabled() / rm_scope_repo_enabled(): cached in
# _FORCE_SCOPE_CACHE, invoked LAZILY only after a command plausibly carries a

# commands that are not force ops. The config read is best-effort: any parse

# QUOTE-AWARE COMMAND SEGMENTATION (#3755)
#
# The three segment parsers below (parse_force_ops, lifecycle_or_cloud_reason,
# extract_rm_targets) split a command string on the shell separators ; | & && ||
# to find each simple command's command word. The historical split was a naive
#   gsub(/&&|\|\||[;|&]/, "\n")
# over the raw string, which has NO lexer — so a `|`-alternation INSIDE a quoted
# argument (e.g. `grep -E "lifecycle|halt|poweroff"`) was split as if it were a
# real pipe, manufacturing a phantom segment whose command word is the bare word
# `halt` and hard-denying a completely read-only command.
#
# `qsplit()` replaces that gsub: it walks the string tracking single-/double-quote
# state and emits a newline for a separator ONLY when it is OUTSIDE a quoted span.
# A quoted span is treated as inert (its separators are preserved as literal
# text) ONLY when it carries no command substitution — no `$(` and no backtick —
# mirroring strip_literal_text()'s #3679 safety floor: a smuggled
# `"$(a|halt)"` keeps its separators ACTIVE so the genuine protection is intact.
# The token VALUES are preserved verbatim (unlike a redaction approach), so
# extract_rm_targets still sees the real `rm` targets. Best-effort like
# strip_literal_text(): backslash-escaped quotes and an unterminated quote fall
# back to the old separator-active behaviour, never widening a deny into an allow.
#
# Shared as a single awk source string so the three parsers cannot drift.

# CD-ARGUMENT TILDE / $HOME EXPANSION (#5315)
#
# The three `cd`-tracking blocks below (extract_write_targets, parse_force_ops,
# resolve_stash_cwd) thread a `cd <dir> &&` prefix through the later segments of
# a compound command by joining <dir> onto a tracked `curcwd`. That join is a
# plain string concatenation with NO word expansion — so a `cd ~/GitHub/loom`
# prefix was joined VERBATIM, embedding a literal `~` mid-path
# (`.../loom/~/GitHub/loom/...`) and mis-resolving every later relative write /
# force-op / stash target of that command (the false positive reported in
# #5315). Only a leading `/` (already-absolute) was handled specially; a leading
# `~` or `$HOME` fell through to the plain repo-relative join.
#
# expand_cd_arg() performs the SAME narrow, unambiguous slice of shell word
# expansion the bash-side expand_leading_tilde() (#4382) already applies to
# write TARGETS, but for the cd ARGUMENT and inside awk (which the write-target
# helper runs too late to reach). `home` is the guard process's own $HOME,
# passed in via `-v home=...` exactly like expand_leading_tilde() reads the
# guard's process $HOME — a same-line `HOME=<x> cmd` prefix in the analyzed
# command text can never redefine it. Handled here:
#   ~            -> home
#   ~/rest       -> home "/rest"
#   $HOME        -> home
#   $HOME/rest   -> home "/rest"
# An expanded value starts with `/`, so the caller's existing `~ /^\//` branch
# then treats it as an ABSOLUTE curcwd (correct — `cd ~` replaces the cwd, it is
# not appended to it).
#
# Left DELIBERATELY UNEXPANDED (returned unchanged, so the caller joins it
# repo-relative — the fail-CLOSED direction this file always biases toward, and
# the same convention already used for `cd -` / a bare `cd`):
#   ~user, ~user/rest   awk cannot safely resolve another user's home (no
#                       getent/dscl without a shell-injection surface); leaving
#                       it repo-relative keeps a genuinely-out-of-tree write
#                       classified as in-tree (denied) rather than guessing it
#                       safe. See the #5315 DECISION note at the head of
#                       extract_write_targets() for the ~user/EPHEMERAL rationale.
# Because qsplit() copies a quoted span VERBATIM (including its quote chars) and
# leaves a literal backslash untouched, a token the real shell would NOT expand
# does not start with a bare `~`/`$HOME` here and falls through unchanged —
#   '~/x' / "~/x"  -> starts with a quote char (shell never tilde-expands it)
#   \~/x           -> starts with a backslash (shell never tilde-expands it)
#   foo~/x         -> tilde is not leading (not an expansion position)
# mirroring expand_leading_tilde()'s quoted-tilde treatment exactly. If `home`
# is empty (HOME unset) every case falls through unchanged, matching that
# helper's `[[ -n "$HOME" ]]` guard.

# strip_cd_quoting() (#5363) — full quote-removal absolute/relative
# CLASSIFICATION helper for a tracked `cd` argument. Used by the three
# `cd`-tracking awk blocks in this file — extract_write_targets() (the
# write-confinement hard-deny path), parse_force_ops(), and
# resolve_stash_cwd() (the latter two feed the ask-gate for
# force-push/reset-hard branch identity and stash-scope cwd resolution,
# wired up in #5372) — NEVER on the RAW cdarg threaded into curcwd itself
# (see each call site's own comment for why).
#
# The #4933/#4941 fix (cdqc/cdlen leading-and-matching-trailing-quote strip)
# only recognizes a FULLY quoted argument ('/abs/path', "/abs/path"): it peels
# one leading quote character and, if the LAST character of the token is the
# SAME quote character, one trailing one. A PARTIALLY quoted absolute
# argument -- the quote closes mid-token, e.g. '<main>'/defaults -- still
# starts with a quote character, so it fails that narrow test and falls
# through unchanged, still starting with a quote rather than `/`, and is
# misclassified as RELATIVE -- the same masked-allow shape as #4933/#4926,
# reached through a partially-quoted `cd` argument instead of a fully-quoted
# or unquoted one (#5363).
#
# strip_cd_quoting() instead walks the ENTIRE token character-by-character,
# stripping every quote character (both single- and double-quoted spans, with
# ordinary shell nesting: a `"` is literal data inside a `'...'` span and vice
# versa) rather than only a leading/trailing pair -- so '<main>'/defaults
# correctly unquotes to <main>/defaults, which DOES start with `/`, and
# classifies as absolute. This mirrors (but, being pure awk, cannot literally
# share code with) the shell layer's _scan_token_quoting() used by
# strip_target_quoting() for the write-TARGET side (#4926) -- that scanner is
# unreachable from here because this decision is made entirely inside awk,
# before the shell layer ever sees a token. Backslash-escapes and `$` are
# deliberately left untouched (out of scope for a leading-`/` classification
# test, and the existing unresolved-`$` detector downstream,
# mark_expandable_dollars()/#4921, still needs the RAW curcwd this function
# never touches).
#
# Returns the token UNCHANGED whenever a quote is left open at end-of-token
# (in_s or in_d still true) -- an unbalanced/unterminated quote can therefore
# only ever KEEP today's classification, never flip a relative-looking token
# into an absolute one it never proved (same fallback contract as

#
# Extracted to a shared awk source string (#6152, same pattern as

# `"$(mktemp/out.txt`-shaped token the issue reports -- rather than either
# resolving correctly or staying an intact, unresolved literal.
#
# Walks `seg` one character at a time from just after the `=`, tracking

# never enters a quoted mode at all, so its first unquoted space still ends

# the double-quote-pair test in resolve_var_q() (and the leading-`$` test
# inside resolve_var()) then both miss, so a target whose value the resolver had
# ALREADY recorded from a literal same-command assignment moments earlier fell
# through unresolved and denied with `worktree-write-confinement-unresolved-
# var`. The identical command WITHOUT the `$(...)` wrapper resolved fine, so
# this was a tokenization gap, not an intentional "a substitution is a fresh
# unresolvable scope" rule (#6940; same defect class as the #6444 quote gap
# directly below).
#
# NARROWNESS -- only an UNBALANCED trailing `)` is stripped: the token`s own
# parens are counted, and at most (closes - opens) trailing `)` characters are
# removed. A paren that belongs to the TOKEN ITSELF is therefore never touched,
# which is what keeps the fail-closed contract intact for the cases that matter:
#   - `$(mktemp -d)` / `"$(mktemp)"` as the target is BALANCED -> untouched ->
#     still not a bare variable reference -> still unresolvable -> still denies.
#   - `$(mktemp))` (a dynamic target inside an enclosing substitution) loses
#     exactly ONE paren, leaving `$(mktemp)` -- still unresolvable, still denies.
#   - a process substitution argument (`>(cmd)`) is balanced -> untouched.
# Parens inside a quoted span are counted like any other, so quoted paren DATA
# can only ever SUPPRESS a strip (leaving the pre-#6940 unresolved/deny
# behavior), never manufacture one.
#
# Stripping cannot widen an allow on its own either: the returned token is
# still handed to resolve_var() (unchanged fail-closed semantics -- an
# unresolvable name comes back untouched) and the resolved path is still run
# through the SAME containment check, so this can never grant more than writing
# that literal path outright would already grant (the #6172 argument). Removing

# QUOTE- AND ARITHMETIC/TEST-CONTEXT-AWARE REDIRECTION MASKING (#4245, #5515)
#
# extract_write_targets() (below) recognizes `>`/`>>` redirection by splitting
# a qsplit()-segmented command on whitespace and pattern-matching each token —
# but that whitespace split is NOT quote-aware, so a `>` that is DATA inside a
# quoted argument (e.g. `gh issue create --body "... env > config > default
# ..."`) can land in its own whitespace-bounded "token" and be misread as a
# real redirection operator, manufacturing a phantom write target and denying
# a command that writes nothing to the filesystem (#4245; same failure class
# as the #3755 qsplit()/#3679 strip_literal_text() quoting fixes above).
#
# mask_gt() walks the string tracking quote state (single-quoted,
# double-quoted, unquoted) and replaces every `>` found INSIDE a quoted span
# with SOH (0x01, a character that can never appear in a shell command and so
# can never itself be mis-split into a phantom target). It otherwise returns
# the input UNCHANGED byte-for-byte (same length, same whitespace positions),
# so a caller can split both the original and the masked string on whitespace
# and get IDENTICAL token boundaries — the masked tokens are used only to
# DECIDE whether a token is a real (unquoted) redirection operator; the
# ORIGINAL tokens are still used to extract the actual target text.
#
# ARITHMETIC/TEST CONTEXT (#5515): an unquoted `>`/`>=`/`<`/`<=` is ALSO not a
# redirection operator when it is a comparison inside a `(( ... ))` arithmetic
# command/expansion or a `[[ ... ]]` conditional expression — a routine bash
# idiom (`if (( x > 0 )); then`, `(( ${#ARR[@]} > 0 ))`, `[[ "$a" > "$b" ]]`).
# Before #5515, mask_gt() left those bytes unmasked (they are unquoted), so
# extract_write_targets()'s bare-operator branch read the token immediately
# after a bare `>` as a write target (`(( x > 0 ))` -> phantom target `0`), and
# its attached-form branch matched the `>=` token shape (never a valid
# redirection operator in POSIX/bash) and stripped its leading `>`, leaving a
# phantom target of literal `=` (`(( x >= y ))` -> phantom target `=`). Both
# resolve inside curcwd and can trigger a worktree-write-confinement DENY on a
# command that writes nothing.
#
# mask_gt() now ALSO tracks `((`/`))` and `[[`/`]]` span depth (adepth/tdepth
# below) the same way it tracks quote state, and masks `>`/`<` bytes found
# while depth > 0 exactly like a quoted `>` — same MASK byte, same
# byte-for-byte-length-identical contract. A span opens only on the LITERAL
# adjacent two-character sequence `((`/`[[` (consumed as one step, so a
# subsequent stray third paren/bracket is not itself misread as another open)
# and closes on the literal adjacent `))`/`]]` while its own depth is > 0 —
# nested single parens inside an arithmetic span (`(( (a) > 0 ))`) do not
# perturb depth, matching the common case this fix targets. A `>` OUTSIDE any
# such span — including one following a closed arithmetic span on the SAME
# segment, e.g. `echo $(( x > 0 )) > file` — is untouched and still flows
# through as a real operator, so the genuinely dangerous cases (`cp`/`mv`/
# `tee`/`sed -i`/actual redirection writing into the main checkout) keep
# denying. This span tracking only ever runs in unquoted mode (mode == 0
# below): a literal `((`/`[[` appearing as DATA inside a quoted string is
# never treated as entering a span, matching how such a string's `>` is
# already unconditionally masked as quoted data regardless of context.
#
# BACKSLASH-ESCAPED QUOTES (#6472): a bare `"`/`'"'"'` byte toggles `mode` above
# UNCONDITIONALLY -- including one that is backslash-escaped and therefore, in
# real shell semantics, still just literal DATA inside the CURRENTLY open span
# (never closes it). A nested/escaped-quoting construct (e.g. a `python3 -c
# "...'"'"'awk \"\$1 > \"x\"\"'"'"'..."` argument -- a double-quoted awk program
# reached through an ADDITIONAL layer of escaped quoting) could therefore have
# its escaped `\"` misread as closing the outer double-quoted span early,
# flipping `mode` back to 0 (unquoted) mid-string -- so a `>` that is still
# genuinely quoted DATA from the real shell'"'"'s point of view is left unmasked
# and reaches extract_write_targets() as if it were a live redirect operator,
# manufacturing a phantom write target out of whatever quoted text follows it.
#
# Fixed narrowly: an `esc` flag tracks "the previous byte was an unescaped
# backslash in a context where backslash-escaping applies" -- unquoted (mode
# 0) or double-quoted (mode 2) ONLY, never single-quoted (mode 1), where a
# backslash is itself just a literal byte with no escaping power in real bash
# (`'"'"'a\'"'"'` really does end the single-quoted span at that `'"'"'`, backslash or
# not). While `esc` is set, the current byte is treated as literal data -- it
# cannot toggle `mode`, open/close an arithmetic/test span, or (in
# double-quoted mode, where every `>` is already masked regardless of escaping)
# change how it is masked -- and `esc` is cleared. This is the SAME "byte
# consumed, one-for-one, same output length" contract every other pass in this
# function already keeps, so the parallel-tokenization invariant
# extract_write_targets() depends on (masked text is byte-for-byte
# length-identical to the original) is untouched.
#
# Deliberately does NOT extend escape-awareness to qsplit() or
# strip_literal_text() -- same simplification those two accept for their own
# quote-tracking scans, and still correct here for a specific reason: the text
# mask_gt() receives (COMMAND_ASK_SCAN, see extract_write_targets() below) has,
# for the specific commands that trigger it (only ones naming --body/--message/
# --title/--notes/--comment/-m/--search/--arg), typically already been through
# strip_literal_text()'"'"'s OWN escape-blind redaction, which can shift a quote'"'"'s
# effective position (e.g. an escaped `\"` inside a redacted --body value loses
# its backslash, since the redaction'"'"'s own quote-matching stops at the first
# bare `"` it finds). For THOSE commands, by the time mask_gt() runs the
# backslash is already gone from the text it sees, so this fix'"'"'s `esc` flag
# simply never fires there either -- mask_gt() falls back to the exact same
# escape-blind toggle-on-every-quote-char behavior as before, so no NEW
# quote-parity desync with strip_literal_text() is introduced for that subset
# of commands. The fix only changes behavior for the (much larger) set of
# commands strip_literal_text() never touches at all, where no such
# already-mangled-backslash text exists to desync against in the first place.
# Same accepted risk direction as qsplit(): pathological unbalanced-quote input
# could in theory shift parity and mis-mask a genuine unquoted `>`, but that is
# the same best-effort risk this file already accepts for `;|&` segmentation --
# never a NEW risk introduced here. An unterminated quote (no matching close
# before end-of-string) just runs to the end of the string in that quote state
# -- never crashes, never mis-indexes. Same acceptance for an unbalanced
# `((`/`[[` span: depth simply never returns to 0 for the rest of the buffer,
# masking any LATER unquoted `>`/`<` too -- the same "never widen a deny into
# an allow" fallback direction every other best-effort scan in this file takes
# (a masked-away `>` can only DROP a write target, never invent a new deny).

# QUOTE-AWARE WHITESPACE MASKING (#4934)
#
# extract_write_targets() (below) recognizes each write-idiom argument by
# `split(seg, toks, /[ \t]+/)` — plain whitespace splitting, NOT quote-aware
# (documented as a known limitation at extract_write_targets()'s own header).
# A quoted target containing a literal space, e.g.
#   echo x > '/main/checkout/evil file.sh'
# is therefore split into TWO tokens (`'/main/checkout/evil` and `file.sh'`).
# Only the first fragment is ever used as the write target. That fragment
# starts with a quote character (not `/`), so it is misclassified as a
# RELATIVE path (strip_target_quoting() correctly reports the dangling quote
# as unbalanced and falls back to the raw fragment per #4926's "never widen a
# deny into an allow" contract -- but the fallback fragment itself still gets
# cwd-joined and can land INSIDE the acting worktree, turning what should be
# a main-checkout DENY into an ALLOW (#4934).
#
# mask_ws() is the same masking technique as mask_gt() above (#4245), applied
# to whitespace instead of `>`: it walks the string tracking quote state and
# replaces every space/tab found INSIDE a quoted span with a placeholder
# character that can never appear in real shell text (STX 0x02 for a masked
# space, ETX 0x03 for a masked tab), so `split(seg, toks, /[ \t]+/)` never
# splits inside a quoted span -- a quoted path containing spaces now yields
# exactly ONE token. unmask_ws() reverses the substitution so the token's
# TEXT is unchanged (real spaces/tabs restored) once splitting is done; only
# the whitespace bytes INSIDE quotes are ever touched, so mask_ws() (like
# mask_gt()) returns a byte-for-byte-length-identical string with identical
# non-whitespace content, which is what keeps the `>`-detection pass (mtoks[],
# masked via mask_gt() on top of mask_ws()'s output) in lockstep with the
# target-text pass (toks[], unmasked back to real whitespace): the two are
# always split into the SAME number of tokens at the SAME boundaries, because
# mask_gt() only ever changes `>` bytes, never whitespace-ness.
#
# Deliberately does NOT model backslash-escaped quotes or attempt look-ahead
# for a terminating quote — same simplification qsplit()/mask_gt() already
# accept (see mask_gt()'s comment above for the accepted-risk rationale). An
# unterminated quote just runs to the end of the string in that quote state;
# never crashes, never mis-indexes, and never widens a deny into an allow
# (the SAME fallback direction qsplit()'s own unterminated-quote handling
# already uses, #4926).
#

# verbatim-quote-preservation contract (depended on by extract_rm_targets() /
# parse_force_ops()) is untouched -- but as of #6968 both functions apply the

# HEREDOC-BODY MASKING (#5000)
#
# extract_write_targets() (below) is fed the RAW, un-redacted value of a
# --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment flag whenever strip_literal_text()'s own
# `$(`/backtick safety floor (#3679) declines to redact it -- the common
# real-world trigger being a heredoc-wrapped value, `--body "$(cat <<'EOF'
# ... EOF)"`, this repo's OWN recommended idiom (see CLAUDE.md/builder role)
# for any multi-line/special-character body text. A `>` (or `;`, `&`, `|`, or
# a write-idiom command word like `tee`) sitting on a heredoc BODY line is
# inert DATA *to the OUTER shell* -- the outer shell never shell-parses a
# heredoc body for redirection/separator syntax, regardless of whether its
# delimiter is quoted (see KNOWN LIMITATIONS below for two narrow cases where
# that is not the end of the story) -- but qsplit()/mask_gt()/mask_ws() are
# (like awk itself) driven one
# PHYSICAL LINE at a time, with no memory of the `"` opened several lines
# earlier once a later heredoc-body line is reached, so a write-idiom-looking
# byte on such a line was misread as real shell syntax, manufacturing a
# phantom write target and denying a command that writes nothing to the
# filesystem (#5000; same failure family as #4245/#3679, one line-boundary
# narrower).
#
# mask_heredoc_bodies() sidesteps that per-line memory gap entirely rather
# than teaching qsplit()/mask_gt()/mask_ws() cross-line state -- those three
# are SHARED with extract_rm_targets()/parse_force_ops()/
# lifecycle_or_cloud_reason(), out of THIS fix's scope (#5000's own Affected
# Files list names only strip_literal_text() and extract_write_targets()/
# mask_gt()). It walks the WHOLE (possibly multi-line) buffer ONCE, looking
# for a `<<`/`<<-` heredoc opener whose delimiter is a bare or single/double
# -quoted identifier (`EOF`, `'EOF'`, `"EOF"`, ... -- the near-universal
# real-world shape), then replaces every byte of the BODY -- every full line
# strictly between the opener line and the first following line that is
# exactly (barring `<<-`'s permitted leading tabs) the bare delimiter -- with
# a neutral placeholder byte (ETB, 0x17: never meaningful shell syntax, never
# matched by any pattern elsewhere in this file). Real newlines, the opener
# line, and the delimiter line itself are all left untouched, so line counts
# and the surrounding qsplit()/strip_literal_text() `$(`-floor logic are
# unaffected -- ONLY the inert body content disappears.
#
# MASK ONLY A *CLOSED* BLOCK (#5087 -- the fail-open regression this two-pass
# structure exists to prevent). The masking decision is made per candidate
# opener with the closing-delimiter line ALREADY LOCATED: for each candidate
# on a line, a forward scan looks for the terminating bare-delimiter line
# FIRST, and only a block that is genuinely closed inside this buffer has its
# body masked. A candidate whose delimiter line never appears masks NOTHING
# and the scan simply moves on to the next candidate -- because the original
# single-pass form (which flipped a sticky `inbody` flag the instant it saw
# `<<` and only ever cleared it on a delimiter line) silently masked
# EVERYTHING from a FALSE opener to the end of the command whenever no such
# line followed, swallowing any real `>`/`tee`/`cp`/`mv` target after it and
# defeating the write-confinement guard (#4178) outright. Two ordinary,
# heredoc-free command shapes hit that: a quoted string that merely CONTAINS
# `<<TOKEN` (`echo "test <<TOKEN"`), and an arithmetic bitshift
# (`x=$((1 << 3))`) -- both followed by a genuine out-of-worktree write, both
# ALLOWed pre-#5087 where `main` DENIed. Masking is a NARROWING operation, so
# it must never be applied speculatively: when in doubt, mask nothing and let
# the text flow through the pre-#5000 per-line scan.
#
# Opener detection is correspondingly tightened so the commonest false
# openers are rejected before the forward scan even runs: a `<<<` herestring
# is never a heredoc opener, and a BARE (unquoted) delimiter starting with a
# DIGIT is read as an arithmetic shift operand (`1 << 3`), not a delimiter --
# `<<'3'`/`<<"3"` stay recognized, since an explicitly quoted delimiter is
# unambiguous heredoc intent. Every `<<` occurrence on a line is considered
# in turn (not just the first), so one rejected candidate never hides a real
# terminated heredoc later on the same line.
#
# Deliberately narrow / best-effort, consistent with every other quote-
# tracking scan in this file: an exotic delimiter (not a bare identifier, or
# using shell metacharacters) is simply not recognized as a heredoc opener --
# fail-open for THIS masking pass only, never a NEW risk, since the text then
# flows through the pre-#5000 per-line scan exactly as it always has. Never
# denies by itself; only ever narrows what extract_write_targets() can find,
# matching that scanner's own documented fail-open contract (a missed target
# is the accepted safe direction there) -- a real write-idiom byte OUTSIDE
# any recognized heredoc body, even in the SAME multi-line command, is
# completely unaffected and still flows through unchanged.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATIONS (#5117 -- surfaced during Judge re-review of #5085, left
# in place deliberately rather than folded into that fix):
#
#   1. Interpreter-fed heredocs -- CLOSED for heredocs (#5351), broader
#      interpreter-mediated writes still open. "Inert to the outer shell"
#      (above) is NOT the same as "inert, full stop." When the heredoc body IS
#      the script handed to an interpreter -- `bash <<'EOF' ... EOF`,
#      `cat <<'EOF' ... EOF | bash`, `sh -s <<'EOF' ... EOF` -- a write-idiom
#      line inside that body is genuinely live code to the INNER interpreter,
#      even though the outer shell never parses it as redirection/separator
#      syntax. Plain mask_heredoc_bodies() masks it anyway, so a write that
#      `origin/main`'s single-pass scan correctly caught would be missed.
#      ORIGINAL DECISION (#5117): deferred -- extract_write_targets() kept
#      calling plain mask_heredoc_bodies() and masked interpreter-fed bodies,
#      an accepted ask-tier tradeoff (missed ASK, worst case), while #5198
#      introduced mask_heredoc_bodies_selective() for the CATASTROPHIC tier
#      only (masking an interpreter-fed body there flips a DENY to an ALLOW on
#      the #4523/#4601/#4685 data-loss shape -- never acceptable).
#      UPDATED DECISION (#5351): the deferral no longer stands. The catastrophic
#      tier proved the approach, so extract_write_targets() now ALSO calls
#      mask_heredoc_bodies_selective() (see its END block below) -- both tiers
#      share the same interpreter-aware masking. _selective() recognizes an
#      interpreter-fed opener and leaves that block's body VISIBLE to the scan
#      (so a write into the main checkout inside a `bash <<'EOF' ... EOF` body
#      now DENYs from a managed worktree), while still masking every
#      non-interpreter-fed heredoc in the same command -- so the #4914/#5000/
#      #5181 false-positive fixes (an inert `cat`-body / `--body "$(cat <<'EOF'
#      ... EOF)"` sink) stay intact.
#      STILL OPEN (its own follow-up, NOT closed here): the BROADER,
#      heredoc-independent class of interpreter-mediated writes -- `bash -c
#      '... > f'`, `printf ... | bash`, `dd of=f`, `install -m ... f` -- which
#      extract_write_targets(), a command-word-based scanner, still does not
#      cover regardless of heredocs. Closing that (spotting an inner interpreter
#      invocation and recursively re-scanning its script/stdin argument) is a
#      materially larger, separate piece of work than the heredoc masking pass
#      and is deliberately out of scope for #5351.
#      NARROWED (#6353): the write-confinement scan (extract_write_targets(),
#      via mask_heredoc_bodies_selective(buf, 1)) no longer treats
#      python[0-9.]*/perl/ruby/node/nodejs as "interpreter-fed" for THIS
#      purpose -- only bash/sh/zsh/dash/ksh/eval/source/. keep the #5351
#      "leave body visible" treatment there. Those four languages never
#      resolved a heredoc-body `>`/`>=`/`<`/`<=` to a write/read redirect in
#      their own syntax in the first place (it is an ordinary comparison
#      operator), so leaving their bodies visible bought no real protection
#      while manufacturing false DENYs on ordinary code. The catastrophic
#      tier's gh-api-rawfield-body-literal-at check (#5198) and the general
#      COMMAND_ASK_SCAN heredoc pass are UNCHANGED -- they still call
#      mask_heredoc_bodies_selective() with shell_only unset, so all five
#      language families stay "interpreter-fed" for those two purposes.
#      FURTHER NARROWED (#7247): the same write-confinement-only call also now
#      masks an UNQUOTED-delimiter body (not just quoted ones) when the opener
#      is non-interpreter-fed AND the body is proven `$(`/backtick-expansion-
#      free (_heredoc_body_expansion_free()) -- see mask_heredoc_bodies_
#      selective()'s own header comment for the full rationale. Fixes the
#      plain `cat > /path/to/file <<EOF ... EOF` shape, where prose containing
#      a literal `>` (e.g. "rotting >=3d, clean") was mis-tokenized as a
#      second, bogus redirect target.
#
#   2. Crafted false opener whose delimiter later appears. Opener detection
#      (heredoc_delim_at()) runs on a single physical line, before qsplit()
#      -- it cannot know a `<<TOKEN` substring actually sits inside a quoted
#      string on that line (e.g. `echo "test <<EOF" > /etc/passwd`). If a
#      later line in the SAME buffer happens to equal the bare delimiter
#      (`EOF`) for unrelated reasons, PASS 1 finds it and PASS 2 masks every
#      line in between -- even though real bash treats the whole `<<EOF`
#      substring as quoted text (no heredoc at all) and executes the write
#      immediately. `origin/main` denies this; this masking pass ALLOWs it.
#      This is explicitly NOT fixed here: doing so would require teaching
#      heredoc_delim_at() the same quote state qsplit() tracks, and
#      qsplit()/mask_gt()/mask_ws() are SHARED with extract_rm_targets()/
#      parse_force_ops()/lifecycle_or_cloud_reason() -- exactly the
#      cross-function coupling #5000 deliberately avoided by giving
#      mask_heredoc_bodies() its own single, whole-buffer pre-pass instead of
#      threading state through the shared per-line scanners. A structural
#      fix belongs in its own issue, scoped against that coupling risk, not
#      folded in here.

# either the opener command itself (`bash <<EOF`, `sh -s <<EOF`,
# `python3 <<EOF`, `eval <<EOF`, `source <<EOF`, `. <<EOF`) or the opener is
# piped into one on the same line (`cat <<EOF | bash`). Deliberately a
# whole-line, best-effort check (matching the "narrow / best-effort" style
# of heredoc_delim_at() above): the interpreter must be the COMMAND WORD of
# some segment of the line, not an arbitrary substring -- e.g.
# `echo "installs bash" <<EOF` does NOT match, since "bash" there is a bare
# argument, not the command word.
#
# Recognizing the command word robustly (#5205, widened #5226): the
# interpreter word is matched against the path BASENAME of each segment
# command word, after normalizing away the shell decorations that do not
# change what actually executes --
#   * quoting / backslash-escaping of the command word itself
#     (`"bash" <<EOF`, `\bash <<EOF` -- the classic alias-dodge idiom),
#   * a bare `VAR=value` assignment prefix (`LC_ALL=C bash <<EOF`),
#   * a leading wrapper command with its own flags, assignments and
#     numeric/duration operands (env, command, exec, builtin, sudo, doas,
#     nohup, setsid, nice, ionice, stdbuf, timeout, time, xargs, unbuffer).
# So `/bin/bash <<EOF`, `env bash <<EOF`, `LC_ALL=C bash <<EOF`,
# `sudo bash <<EOF`, `cat <<EOF | sudo bash`, `timeout 60 bash <<EOF`,
# `"bash" <<EOF`, `\bash <<EOF` and `/usr/bin/python3 <<EOF` all resolve to
# the same real interpreter and are caught, closing the evasion class where
# those forms slipped past the older first-token-only / unwrapped checks and
# got their live bodies silently masked (i.e. ALLOWed).
#
# FAIL-CLOSED TAIL (#5226): an interpreter allowlist is an unbounded tail --
# there is always one more wrapper. The residual class no allowlist can ever
# enumerate is a command word the guard cannot resolve to a NAME at all:
# `$SHELL <<EOF`, `${INTERP} <<EOF`, `$(which bash) <<EOF`. Those are treated
# as interpreter-fed, so the body stays visible and the catastrophic-tier
# check still sees any live invocation inside it.
#
# Inverting the whole test (mask ONLY for a known-inert SINK allowlist, so
# every unknown opener fails closed) was considered and deliberately
# rejected: the canonical Loom issue-filing idiom is
# `create-issue.sh --title T --body "$(cat <<EOF ... EOF)"`, whose command
# word is an ordinary repo script -- as is every other repo wrapper around a
# forge call. Under a sink allowlist each of those hard-stalls on a
# catastrophic-tier deny the moment the prose it carries quotes the
# anti-pattern, which is precisely the #5181 false positive this masking
# exists to fix (that bug was found when an agent could not file the report
# about it). So the default for a resolvable-but-unknown command word stays

# building the body, even when the sink is an inert command like `cat` --
# masking it would blank a genuinely live command out of the scan
# (regression found and fixed in review of #5779/#5781; a single-quoted
# `<<'"'"'EOF'"'"'` body has no such expansion and stays maskable). Used by
# BOTH tiers: the gh-api-rawfield-body-literal-at catastrophic check (#5198)
# and, as of #5351, the extract_write_targets() ask-tier write-confinement
# scan (the END-block call below) -- so a write into the main checkout
# inside an interpreter-fed heredoc body is no longer masked out of the
# confinement check. Plain mask_heredoc_bodies() above is retained as the
# reference primitive (identical minus the interpreter carve-out) but now
# has no runtime caller.
#
# shell_only (#6353): an OPTIONAL second argument, forwarded verbatim to
# is_interpreter_opener() -- see the header comment on that function for the
# full rationale. Left unset by the #5198 gh-api-rawfield-body-literal-at
# caller and the general COMMAND_ASK_SCAN heredoc pass (both keep treating
# python/perl/ruby/node[js] heredoc bodies as interpreter-fed, unchanged);
# passed as 1 ONLY by the internal call inside extract_write_targets(), so
# just the worktree-write-confinement scan narrows to shell interpreters.
#
# UNQUOTED-DELIMITER, shell_only-ONLY narrowing (#7247): an UNQUOTED-delimiter
# body (`<<EOF`, not `<<'"'"'EOF'"'"'`) is masked TOO, but ONLY when shell_only
# is truthy (i.e. ONLY for the internal call inside extract_write_targets())
# AND both of the following hold:
#   1. the opener is NOT interpreter-fed per is_interpreter_opener(line,
#      shell_only) -- an unquoted body handed to a real shell interpreter
#      (bash/sh/zsh/dash/ksh/eval/source/.) stays visible exactly as before;
#      only a plain sink (`cat`, `tee`, a repo script, or -- thanks to the
#      shell_only narrowing already applied inside is_interpreter_opener()
#      itself, #6353 -- python/perl/ruby/node[js]) qualifies here.
#   2. the body is PROVABLY free of `$(`/unescaped-backtick expansion, per
#      _heredoc_body_expansion_free() (defined below) -- the same proof
#      mask_unquoted_cat_heredoc_bodies() (#6056) already requires for its
#      narrower flag-capture idiom. A body containing a live `$(...)`/backtick
#      command substitution is NOT masked and stays fully visible to this scan.
#
# This closes the plain `cat > /path/to/file <<EOF ... EOF` false positive
# (#7247): ordinary prose containing a literal `>` (e.g. "rotting >=3d, clean")
# was mis-tokenized by the downstream `>`/`>>` write-idiom scan as a SECOND
# redirect operator with a bogus, cwd-joined target, manufacturing a
# worktree-write-confinement DENY on a command that performs no write outside
# its one, already-literal target. Gating this on shell_only keeps the
# gh-api-rawfield-body-literal-at catastrophic check and the general
# COMMAND_ASK_SCAN heredoc pass completely unaffected -- only the `>`/`>>`
# scan inside extract_write_targets(), the ONLY consumer that can
# misinterpret plain prose as shell redirect syntax in the first place, is
# narrowed here. Requiring _heredoc_body_expansion_free() means this can only
# ever narrow the scan, never blind it: a genuine `$(rm -rf ...)`/backtick
# command substitution embedded in the body is left fully visible and its
# write target, if any, still denies exactly as before.

#      `> file`) routes cat stdout elsewhere and is left visible,
#   4. the body is expansion-free per _heredoc_body_expansion_free().

# QUOTE-AWARE COMMENT STRIPPING (#6252) -- mask_comment()
#
# COMMAND_NO_COMMENT (built further below) used to strip a `#...end-of-line`
# span whenever the `#` was preceded by whitespace or started a line, WITHOUT
# tracking quote state -- so a `#` inside a single- or double-quoted argument
# (a sed script, a `--body`/`-m`/`--title` prose string, a markdown heading,
# a PR/issue reference like `#958`) was ALSO treated as a comment start,
# truncating everything textually AFTER it. That matters well beyond a
# cosmetic mis-strip: COMMAND_ASK_SCAN (built from COMMAND_NO_COMMENT) is not
# only the ASK/DDL tier's input, it is ALSO the exact input
# extract_write_targets() scans to compute the worktree-write-confinement
# DENY (WRITE_TARGETS, below) -- so the truncation could silently drop a real
# write target from the scan, producing a silent ALLOW where #4178/#4921
# require a DENY. Root-caused in ADR-0016
# (docs/adr/0016-write-target-confinement-approach.md, "Sed / argument-
# position false positive"); live repro: `sed -i '' 's/x/y #958/'
# $SP/file.md`.
#
# mask_comment() walks the string tracking quote state exactly like
# mask_gt()/strip_target_quoting()/mark_expandable_dollars() elsewhere in
# this file (single-quoted, double-quoted, unquoted) and strips a `#...`
# span ONLY when the `#` is UNQUOTED and either starts the buffer, starts a
# new line, or is immediately preceded by a space or tab -- mirroring the
# original sed's `(^|[[:space:]])#.*$` shape exactly, just quote-aware. A
# `#` found while inside a quoted span is never treated as a comment start,
# regardless of what precedes it. Runs over the WHOLE (possibly multi-line)
# buffer in a single pass -- quote state threads across embedded newlines,
# so a quoted argument that itself spans multiple lines is tracked
# correctly too, unlike sed'"'"'s original per-physical-line pattern space.
#
# Deliberately does NOT model backslash-escaped quotes -- same accepted
# simplification qsplit()/mask_gt()/strip_target_quoting() already make for
# this file'"'"'s other quote-tracking scans (see mask_gt()'"'"'s header for the
# detailed rationale). An unterminated quote just runs to the end of the
# buffer in that quote state -- never crashes, never mis-indexes, and only
# ever risks UNDER-stripping (leaving more text visible to the ASK/DDL tier
# and the write-confinement scan), never over-stripping into a missed DENY.

# Parse force-op segments out of a command, emitting one TAB-separated
# "<cpath>\t<target>" line per genuine git force-push / hard-reset. Portable awk
# only (mirrors extract_rm_targets / lifecycle_or_cloud_reason segment parsing):
#   - split on ; | & && || and newline, strip a leading sudo wrapper.
#   - only a segment whose command word is `git` is considered.
#   - `git -C <path> ...` sets <cpath>; other pre-subcommand global options are
#     skipped (`-c <k=v>` consumes its argument).
#   - push: emitted only when a --force/-f/--force-with-lease flag is present.
#     ONE line is emitted per positional refspec (pos[2], pos[3], …) after the
#     remote — a multi-refspec push like `git push --force origin a b` emits a
#     line for `a` AND `b`, so a protected branch in any refspec position (not
#     just the first) reaches the caller's per-line check (#3674 follow-up).
#     <target> is the destination branch parsed from each refspec —
#       * `<src>:<dst>` form => <dst>
#       * a bare ref        => the ref with a leading `+` stripped
#       * `HEAD`, or no ref => the literal "@HEAD@" (resolve checked-out branch)
#   - reset --hard: always emitted with <target> = "@HEAD@", PLUS a third
#     SEP-joined field carrying the reset command's own positional TARGET
#     literal verbatim (e.g. "origin/main", "HEAD~1"; defaults to the literal
#     "HEAD" for a bare `git reset --hard` with no positional target — which
#     is also what makes this field ALWAYS non-empty for a reset line, so the
#     caller can tell a reset line apart from a push "@HEAD@" line, whose
#     third field is simply absent, without a separate op-kind marker).
#     reset --hard never switches branches, so branch IDENTITY is still
#     resolved off the checked-out branch via "@HEAD@" as before — this third
#     field only lets the caller recognize a known-safe RECOVERY target
#     (origin/<default>/origin main|master/HEAD) when that identity
#     resolution lands on a detached HEAD (#5772).
# The caller resolves "@HEAD@" to the checked-out branch and applies the mode.
#
# $2 seeds the starting cwd (the hook's own session cwd — callers pass $CWD,
# mirroring extract_write_targets's `startcwd` parameter). A `cd <dir>`
# segment updates that cwd for LATER segments of the SAME command — global awk
# variable `curcwd`, threaded across the per-segment loop exactly like
# extract_write_targets threads it via its own `cd` case (#4933/#4881). This
# closes the false-ask where a command first `cd`s into a worktree (e.g. `cd
# .loom/worktrees/issue-N && git reset --hard origin/feature/issue-N`) while
# the hook's reported session cwd is still the main repo root: without cd
# tracking the "@HEAD@" target resolved against the WRONG checkout (#5156).
#
# The cd-tracked cwd is used ONLY for "@HEAD@"-target lines (reset --hard, and
# a push with no/HEAD refspec) — i.e. only where branch identity actually
# needs resolving against a checkout. A push naming an explicit branch refspec
# keeps deriving its <cpath> from an explicit `-C <path>` ONLY, exactly as
# before: its target is the literal refspec text, not cwd/HEAD-derived, so cd
# tracking must not change its behavior (a still-empty <cpath> there continues
# to fall back to the caller's raw $CWD, unchanged).
#
# SAME-COMMAND VARIABLE RESOLUTION AT THE CWD-CAPTURE POINTS (#6152): both the
# `-C <path>` and `cd <dir>` capture points below now also try resolve_var()
# (the shared _VARRESOLVE_AWK helper, #4881) when the raw argument is a quoted
# or bare `$NAME`/`${NAME}` reference — e.g. the Guide role's own
# `DOCS_WT="..."; git -C "$DOCS_WT" reset --hard HEAD` shape. A preceding
# same-command `NAME=value` assignment is recorded into `varmap` exactly like
# extract_write_targets() does (mirrored below, per-segment, before the
# `cd`/`git` dispatch). resolve_var() itself only matches a BARE `$NAME`
# token, so each capture point first unquotes the raw argument via
# strip_cd_quoting() (#5363/#5372, already used here for classification) —
# this is the ONLY reason strip_cd_quoting() is applied before resolve_var();
# it does not change strip_cd_quoting()'s existing classification-only role
# elsewhere. WHEN RESOLUTION SUCCEEDS the resolved (absolute, unquoted) value
# is used directly, so the #5775 managed-worktree detached-HEAD reset-
# recovery allowlist can actually evaluate it. WHEN IT FAILS (no matching
# assignment, a chained/ambiguous/command-substitution value, or the argument
# was never a variable reference at all) each capture point falls back to
# EXACTLY the pre-#6152 code path — same fail-toward-asking behavior,
# unchanged.
#
# `NAME=$(pwd)` CAPTURE OF A PROVEN SAME-COMMAND `cd` (#6724): the assignment
# scan below special-cases a value of EXACTLY `$(pwd)`/`` `pwd` `` (bare or
# double-quoted) as the RHS — e.g. `cd <worktree>; WORKTREE_ABS="$(pwd)"; git
# -C "$WORKTREE_ABS" reset --hard …` — by recording `varmap[NAME] = curcwd`
# directly instead of routing through record_assign()'s generic literal-string
# path. Without this, record_assign() stores the substitution TEXT
# `$(pwd)`/`` `pwd` `` verbatim, and resolve_var()'s chain-refusal guard
# (`substr(vv, 1, 1) == "$"` at the top of this same block) then correctly
# refuses to touch a value it cannot itself evaluate — so `$WORKTREE_ABS`
# reached the `-C`/`cd` capture points below unresolved even though the
# preceding `cd` already proved the exact path. This carve-out trusts the
# SAME cd-tracking model the "@HEAD@" resolution above already trusts (a
# same-command `cd <path>` is assumed to have succeeded) rather than adding a
# new trust assumption, and it is intentionally narrow:
#   - ONLY the literal `pwd` substitution — any other command substitution
#     (`$(git rev-parse …)`, `$(readlink -f …)`, etc.) is left to fall through
#     to record_assign() unresolved, same as before.
#   - ONLY when a same-command `cd <path>` has actually run earlier in this
#     segment loop, tracked by the dedicated `cd_proven` flag rather than a
#     bare `curcwd != ""` check — `curcwd` itself is seeded from `startcwd`
#     (the hook's own invocation cwd) even when the command has NO `cd` at
#     all, so `curcwd != ""` alone can never distinguish a proven cd from
#     that default seed. With no proven `cd`, the assignment falls through to
#     record_assign() unresolved rather than guessing the hook's own
#     invocation cwd.
#   - a SINGLE-QUOTED `NAME='$(pwd)'` is excluded on purpose: single quotes
#     suppress command substitution, so that RHS is a literal string the
#     shell never evaluates, not a cwd capture.
#
# `NAME=$(cat <file>)` CAPTURE OF A PROVEN SAME-COMMAND `cd` (#7532):
# guard-decision telemetry (#7419, dated AFTER the #6724 fix above already
# merged) showed force-op:detached still firing at ASK for a DIFFERENT
# cwd-capture shape #6724 does not cover — the cwd is round-tripped through a
# FILE instead of a direct `$(pwd)` substitution, e.g.:
#
#   cd <worktree>
#   WORKTREE_ABS=$(cat /tmp/worktree_abs.txt)
#   git -C "$WORKTREE_ABS" reset --hard origin/main
#
# record_assign() stores the substitution TEXT `$(cat /tmp/worktree_abs.txt)`
# verbatim, and resolve_var()'s chain-refusal guard (it starts with `$`) then
# correctly refuses to touch it — so `$WORKTREE_ABS` reaches the `-C`/`cd`
# capture points below unresolved, even when the file already holds exactly
# the same-command `cd` target.
#
# This hook is a PreToolUse guard: it evaluates the WHOLE compound command
# BEFORE any of it runs, so unlike the `$(pwd)` case above (which trusts a
# same-command `cd` to predict a FUTURE `pwd` evaluation), a `$(cat <file>)`
# capture cannot be proven by predicting a future write within the same
# command — nothing has executed yet. What CAN be checked, safely and without
# assuming anything about execution order, is <file>'s content RIGHT NOW: the
# assignment scan below reads it directly off disk (`getline < path`, never a
# write, never an exec) and compares it — verbatim, first line only — against
# the SAME-COMMAND proven `curcwd` (`cd_proven`, exactly the #6724 trust
# gate). Only an EXACT match resolves `varmap[NAME] = curcwd`; this covers a
# file already sitting on disk with the right content (written moments
# earlier by a prior, already-executed command, or via any other legitimate
# means) — it does NOT require <file> to be created inside the guarded
# command's own text, and it never depends on THIS command actually running.
# Narrow scope, mirroring #6724's own narrow scope:
#   - ONLY a literal `cat <file>` substitution (bare, double-quoted, or the
#     `` `cat <file>` `` backtick spelling) — any other command (`$(head -1
#     <file>)`, `$(cat <file1> <file2>)`, etc.) is left to fall through to
#     record_assign() unresolved, same as before.
#   - ONLY when a same-command `cd <path>` has already proven `curcwd`
#     (`cd_proven`) — mirrors #6724 exactly; without a proven `cd` the
#     assignment falls through to record_assign() unresolved.
#   - ONLY an absolute `<file>` argument (`^/`) is read — a relative path is
#     ambiguous (it would depend on the hook's own invocation cwd, not
#     necessarily the command's), so it is left unresolved rather than
#     guessed.
#   - the file's content must match `curcwd` EXACTLY (first line only,
#     trailing newline stripped by `getline`, no other trimming) — any
#     mismatch, an unreadable/missing file, or extra content beyond the first
#     line all fall through to record_assign() unresolved, same
#     fail-toward-asking default as an unresolvable `$VAR` (#6152) or a
#     non-`pwd`/non-`cat` command substitution.
#   - a SINGLE-QUOTED `NAME='$(cat <file>)'` is excluded on purpose, same
#     rationale as the single-quoted `$(pwd)` case above.
#   - `getline < path` only ever READS <file> to compare its content; the
#     guard never writes to it, executes it, or reports its content back to
#     the caller — only the boolean "did it match curcwd" outcome feeds the
#     resolution.

# Redact the quoted VALUES of known text-carrying flags (--body, -m/--message,

# INSIDE such a value no longer trips the raw ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS substring
# scan (catastrophic tier) or the ASK_PATTERNS scan (ask tier, #3756). Used
# ONLY to build the literal-redacted working copies for those two loops
# (mirrors the COMMAND_NO_COMMENT precedent); every other scan keeps reading
# the raw command. This kills the #3679 false positive where `gh pr comment
# --body "…git push --force origin main…"` / `git commit -m "…"` hard-denied
# even though nothing executes, and (#3756) the analogous ask-tier false ask
# where an ask-phrase like `gh issue close` quoted inside a
# `--comment`/`--body` value prompted for confirmation despite no such
# command actually being run.
#
# #5797: `--search` (e.g. `gh issue list --search "docker system prune"`) is a
# read-only query-string value, not an invocation, and gets the same
# same-shape `<flag> "<quoted value>"` redaction as the flags above. A second,
# separate alternative in the regex below handles `jq --arg NAME "<value>"` /
# `jq --argjson NAME "<value>"` — jq's `--arg`/`--argjson` values are filter
# comparands, never executed — which doesn't fit the `<flag> "<value>"` shape
# because jq requires a bare identifier token (NAME) between the flag and the
# quoted value; the second alternative below matches that shape specifically
# so a phrase like `jq --arg p "aws s3 rb" '.'` no longer hard-denies on the
# catastrophic tier (this false positive reproduced there, not only on the
# `cloud-cli` ask tier). Both additions are narrowly scoped to `gh`/`jq`
# read-only value arguments, per the #5214/#5157/#5158 precedent of NOT
# generalizing this into a full qsplit()-segment-parsed rewrite.
#
# Safety floor preserved two ways:
#   - `-c` is deliberately NOT a text-carrying flag, so `bash -c '<payload>'`
#     is never redacted and its payload stays caught by the raw scan.
#   - a DOUBLE-quoted span is redacted ONLY when it carries no command-substitution
#     or backtick opener (`$(` — which also subsumes the arithmetic `$((` — or a
#     backtick). So a smuggling attempt like `git commit -m "$(git push --force
#     origin main)"` is left intact and still hard-denies. A SINGLE-quoted span is
#     always redacted regardless of `$(`/backtick content — real single quotes give
#     bash NO expansion of any kind, so such a span is provably inert either way
#     (#5783; see the qchar == SQ branch at strip_literal_text()'s call site below).
# Each redacted span is replaced by a SAME-LENGTH placeholder so byte offsets of
# the surrounding command are unchanged. Best-effort like COMMAND_NO_COMMENT:
# a backslash-escaped inner double quote (`\"`, DQSPAN below, #7095) IS modeled
# for the double-quoted-span case, but other escape shapes (e.g. an escaped
# quote inside a SINGLE-quoted span, which real bash quoting does not even
# support) are not attempted. Since the result feeds only the narrowing
# (never widening) catastrophic scan, the worst case is a raw substring
# surviving — never a catastrophic block being skipped incorrectly.

# HEREDOC-WRAPPED FLAG VALUES (#5216)

# The `$(`-floor above is exactly right for a general command substitution, but
# it also declines to redact THIS repo's own pervasive idiom for any multi-line
# comment body (CLAUDE.md / judge.md / doctor.md / builder-pr.md all show it):
#
#     gh pr comment 4357 --body "$(cat <<QUOTED_DELIM
#     …prose that may QUOTE a dangerous command as an example…
#     QUOTED_DELIM
#     )" && gh pr edit 4357 --add-label "loom:pr"
#
# Every value built that way necessarily contains `$(`, so before this pass it
# was NEVER redacted — and a dangerous-command example merely quoted inside the
# body (a Judge documenting the shell-injection payload a PR now rejects, an
# Auditor quoting a guard pattern) hard-denied the whole command on the
# catastrophic tier. Observed live in guard-decisions.log on 2026-07-29 (a Judge
# approval on PR #4357) and reproduced for the #3679 force-push literals too:
# the gap is CONSTRUCTION-specific (heredoc-wrapped value), not pattern-specific.
#
# mask_flag_cat_heredocs() (below) closes it by masking ONLY the BODY of a
# heredoc in this one provably-inert shape, and only when ALL of these hold:
#   1. the opener is the complete tail of its line, immediately preceded by a
#      recognized text-carrying flag, its opening quote, and `$(cat`;
#   2. the heredoc delimiter is QUOTED (single- or double-quoted, `<<-` allowed)
#      — a quoted delimiter is what guarantees the outer shell performs NO
#      expansion on the body, so a `$(…)` sitting IN the body is inert text
#      rather than live code (an UNQUOTED delimiter is rejected outright);
#   3. the block is CLOSED in this same buffer (mirrors #5087's "never mask
#      speculatively" rule for mask_heredoc_bodies);
#   4. the very next line after the delimiter line is `)` + that same opening
#      quote — i.e. the substitution ends immediately, with nothing chained
#      after the heredoc inside it.
# Condition 4 is what keeps a `--body "$(cat <<QUOTED_DELIM … QUOTED_DELIM`
# <newline> `rm -rf /` <newline> `)"` command denying: bash ends the heredoc at
# the delimiter line and then genuinely RUNS the following line inside the
# substitution, so nothing is masked there. Condition 1 is what keeps an
# INTERPRETER-FED heredoc denying — a body consumed by `bash <<DELIM`,
# `sh -s <<DELIM`, or `cat <<DELIM … | sh` is live code
# to the inner shell, and none of those match `<flag> <quote>$(cat`. This is the
# deliberate narrowing versus reusing mask_heredoc_bodies() (#5000) here: that
# helper masks ANY closed heredoc body regardless of its consumer, a documented
# and accepted fail-open for the write-target scanner (#5117 Known Limitation 1)
# that must NOT be inherited by the catastrophic hard-deny floor.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION (recorded, mirroring the #5117 convention): this recognizes
# only the literal `cat`-consumed shape spelled out above. A semantically
# equivalent variant — `$(command cat <<DELIM …)`, a heredoc opened on a
# continuation line, or a body whose delimiter line is followed by `) "` with a
# space — is simply not recognized and keeps denying exactly as it does today.
# That is the safe direction (a false positive that already exists, never a new
# bypass), and the shape above is the one the repo's own role prompts prescribe.

# purely positional, e.g. `./.loom/scripts/check-duplicate.sh "TITLE"
# "DESCRIPTION"`. check-duplicate.sh never EXECUTES a positional argument —
# it only reads it as dedup text — so masking a quoted argument immediately
# following it (optionally after short flags, e.g.
# `check-duplicate.sh --include-merged-prs "..."`) can never blind the
# ASK_PATTERNS scan (or any other COMMAND_ASK_SCAN consumer, e.g.
# stash-scope:main-checkout / :worktree-collision / :create-redirect) to a real
# invocation. Deliberately narrow allowlist, same "deliberately narrow"
# convention documented above strip_literal_text()'s
# mask_flag_cat_heredocs(): a command that WRAPS the phrase and then
# executes it — `sh -c "git stash pop"`, `bash -c '...'`, `eval "..."` — is
# NOT in this allowlist and stays fully visible to every ASK_PATTERNS entry,
# exactly as before.
#
# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDES grep/egrep/fgrep/rg, unlike guard-loom-workflow.sh's
# mask_command_positional_args() (#5155/#5160) which this function is
# otherwise modeled on. In THIS file, COMMAND_ASK_SCAN also feeds the SQL
# DDL/DML check (SQL_DDL_PATTERN, below) — which, once a command is
# disqualified from (or has opted out of) the #3687 read-only fast path,
# intentionally scans a `grep <pattern> <file>` invocation's own quoted
# positional pattern for a literal DDL phrase like "DROP TABLE" and denies,
# by design (see the "Fast path security" / "Fast path off" test groups in
# tests/hooks/test-guard-destructive.sh). Adding grep/rg to this allowlist
# was tried and directly regressed those tests: masking grep's own quoted
# argument blinded the full-path SQL-DDL scan to text it is specifically
# tested to still catch. check-duplicate.sh has no such competing consumer
# of its raw argument text anywhere in this file, so it stays the only
# entry. Extend this allowlist only for another read-only positional-arg
# consumer with NO conflicting raw-text scan elsewhere in this file.
#
# This is an intentional NEAR-DUPLICATE of guard-loom-workflow.sh's own
# mask_command_positional_args() (issue #5155/#5160) — kept as a SEPARATE
# function in this file, same convention as strip_literal_text() above being
# a separate copy from that file's strip_literal_text(): the two guards'
# decision-time masking must never be coupled, so a future fix/tuning of one
# cannot silently change the other's behavior.
#
# Masks EVERY quoted argument that directly, consecutively follows the
# command+flags (separated only by whitespace) — not just the first — so
# multi-positional-arg scripts like check-duplicate.sh's `TITLE DESCRIPTION`
# signature get both arguments masked. Masking stops at the first token that

# comment for why: COMMAND_ASK_SCAN also feeds SQL_DDL_PATTERN, which

# so masking grep/rg's own quoted pattern argument on THIS working copy does
# not reintroduce that regression. Without this, `grep -n "curl .*|" <file>` —
# read-only introspection of a guard's own source text — gets misread as a
# live curl-pipe-to-shell invocation by ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS, because grep

# mask_ask_positional_args()'s own allowlist entry for it just above. That
# function's header comment already establishes check-duplicate.sh as safe to
# mask (it never executes either of its TITLE/DESCRIPTION positional
# arguments, only reads them as dedup text) — this was simply missing from
# the catastrophic-tier copy, so a dedup title/description that merely quotes
# a catastrophic-tier phrase (e.g. while filing a bug report ABOUT that
# phrase) hard-denied the read-only dedup check itself.
#
# This is an intentional NEAR-DUPLICATE of mask_ask_positional_args() just
# above (itself a near-duplicate of guard-loom-workflow.sh's
# mask_command_positional_args(), #5155/#5160) — kept as a SEPARATE function
# so a future tuning of one masking pass can never silently change another's
# behavior, per the "never couple the two guards'/tiers' masking" convention
# documented in mask_ask_positional_args()'s header comment above.
#
# #6002: also includes jq. jq is unconditionally admitted with any arguments
# by the #3687/#3772 read-only fast path (fastpath_builtin_admits() above) —
# it never executes its filter-script argument as shell syntax, only reads
# it as a filter program — so masking that same operand here (once the
# command is chained/piped and no longer fast-path-eligible) carries the
# identical safety rationale as fast-path admission, just applied on the
# full-scan path. Without this, a filter script like `jq -c "select(.pattern
# == <phrase>)" file.log`, chained onto another command, previously fell
# through to the raw substring scan below and hard-denied on read-only
# forensic log inspection even though the phrase was only ever quoted DATA
# inside the filter, never a live invocation.

# stash-recovery/-create detectors read below (`_stash_is_recover` /
# `_stash_is_pop` / stash_create_invoked()) — never fed into COMMAND_ASK_SCAN
# itself. mask_ask_positional_args() (#5235) deliberately excludes grep/rg
# from COMMAND_ASK_SCAN because that copy also feeds SQL_DDL_PATTERN, which
# intentionally still scans a `grep '<pattern>' file` invocation's own quoted
# argument for a literal DDL phrase (see that function's header comment).
# stash-scope's detectors have no such competing raw-text consumer, so a
# SEPARATE branched copy (COMMAND_STASH_SCAN, built below) can safely mask
# grep/awk's own search-pattern argument without touching that SQL-DDL
# invariant — mirrors how COMMAND_CLOUD_ASK_SCAN / COMMAND_ASK_SCAN_PRINTENV
# each get their own more-aggressively-masked branch off COMMAND_ASK_SCAN.
#
# Without this, a read-only `grep -n "...git stash pop..." file` or
# `awk '/git stash pop/{...}' file` — searching for a TEST-CASE NAME or other
# literal string that happens to contain "git stash pop/drop/clear" — is
# indistinguishable from a real `git stash pop` invocation to the plain
# substring/regex scan below, and false-triggers stash-scope:worktree-collision
# / stash-scope:main-checkout (confirmed in `.loom/logs/guard-decisions.log`,
# #7363).
#
# ESCAPE-AWARE double-quote scanning (as of #7515 also in
# mask_catastrophic_positional_args() above, which ported this same treatment,
# and in mask_ask_positional_args() above via #7516): the real
# false-positive
# repro from #7363 is `grep -n "^assert_ask \"stash-scope: git stash pop in
# main checkout asks" file` — a single double-quoted argument containing a
# backslash-escaped `\"`. A naive same-character scan stops at that escaped
# quote, leaving "stash-scope: git stash pop in main checkout asks" (a REAL
# match for the recovery regex) fully visible past the truncation point. This
# walks the span character-by-character, treating a backslash together with
# whatever it escapes as one atomic unit (mirroring the DQSPAN idea in
# strip_literal_text() above), so the span closes only on a truly unescaped
# `"`. Single-quoted spans need no such handling — real bash gives backslash no
# special meaning inside single quotes, so the plain same-character scan
# mask_catastrophic_positional_args() already uses is correct there too.

# assignment like:
#
#   PATTERN='catastrophic:aws s3 rb'
#
# — a standalone line, not followed by anything that actually reads
# $PATTERN — hard-denies exactly like a live invocation, even though the
# assigned value is never executed or even referenced again. This is the
# real-world shape seen repeatedly in `.loom/logs/guard-decisions.log` while
# investigating (and filing an issue about) this very false-positive class:
# a forensic/documentation assignment quoting a flagged phrase as inert data.
#
# SAFETY (mirrors mask_catastrophic_forloop_wordlist()'s fail-closed
# contract just below, applied here via the simplest sufficient check for
# this narrower shape): masking only ever happens when `$NAME` and `${NAME}`
# do not appear ANYWHERE in the full original command buffer — checked
# against the TRUE original $COMMAND (passed as $2), not against this
# function's own $1 (the in-progress COMMAND_NO_LITERAL_TEXT working
# buffer), so an EARLIER masking pass's redaction can never hide a live
# reference from this check (#6068 regression: mask_catastrophic_positional_args()
# now runs first in the pipeline and can blank a `"${NAME}"` read inside an
# echo/printf argument before this function ever sees it — checking $1
# instead of the true original would silently reopen the fail-closed
# contract this paragraph promises). Since the assignment
# `NAME=<quote>...<quote>` itself never contains the substring `$NAME` (it
# defines the variable, it does not read it), this single whole-buffer check
# already correctly excludes the assignment's own text — no separate
# self-exclusion bookkeeping is needed. If `$NAME`/`${NAME}` appears
# anywhere else — including a genuinely dangerous consumer like
# `eval "$NAME"`, an unrelated later reassignment that itself reads the old
# value (`NAME="$NAME-more"`), or even an already-trusted inert consumer
# such as `--search "$NAME"` — masking is skipped and the assignment's raw
# text stays fully exposed to the raw substring scan below, exactly as
# before this fix. This is deliberately narrower than "only mask if every
# use is a trusted consumer": it trades a few false-positive assignments
# that DO have a later inert consumer (still denied, no regression — just
# not newly fixed) for a much simpler, more obviously-correct safety
# argument than re-deriving mask_catastrophic_forloop_wordlist()'s full
# consumer-allowlist logic for a different syntactic shape. KNOWN ACCEPTED
# GAP: indirect reads that never spell `$NAME`/`${NAME}` literally (bash
# indirect expansion `${!ref}`, `env`/`printenv` dumps, a second variable
# copied from the first and read under ITS OWN name) are not detected by
# this textual check and so are simply never masked by this pass (fail
# closed, same posture as every other approximation in this file).
#
# Only fires at command position (start of buffer or immediately after one
# of `; & | \` ( <newline>`, mirroring mask_catastrophic_positional_args()'s
# own anchor above) so an incidental `NAME=` substring inside an unrelated
# quoted string or URL query component is not mistaken for an assignment.

# Mask quoted word-list literals inside a `for <var> in "<lit>" "<lit>" ...;
# do ... done` loop, but ONLY when every reference to <var> inside the loop
# body is a provably-inert consumer already trusted elsewhere in this file
# (issue #6002).
#
# Neither strip_literal_text() nor mask_catastrophic_positional_args() above
# touches this shape: the dangerous phrase is a literal token in the for-
# loop's OWN word list, not a value directly following a recognized flag or
# command name — `--search` (etc.) is instead followed by the loop
# VARIABLE (`"$q"`), so the phrase sits structurally distant from any
# command invocation on the same or a later line, e.g.:
#
#   for q in "sql-ddl" "catastrophic:aws s3 rb"; do
#       gh issue list --search "$q" --limit 5
#   done
#
# Blindly masking every for-loop word list would be UNSAFE: the literal
# itself is never executed directly — only its interpolation into <var>
# later matters — so `for cmd in "aws s3 rb s3://victim --force"; do eval
# "$cmd"; done` would silently blind the catastrophic scan to a REAL
# destructive invocation smuggled through the loop variable. This function
# therefore fails CLOSED (leaves the word list fully unmasked, still
# visible to the raw scan below) unless ALL of the following hold:
#
#   1. The loop is fully closed inside this buffer (a `; do`/newline-`do`
#      header and a matching `done`) — mirrors the "must be CLOSED inside
#      this buffer" convention in mask_flag_cat_heredocs() above.
#   2. The body contains no nested for/while/until loop, `eval`, `source`/
#      `. `, or `sh|bash|zsh|dash -c` wrapper — anything that could re-
#      interpret the variable as code rather than read as data.
#   3. The loop variable (`$var` or `${var}`) appears at least once in the
#      body, and EVERY occurrence is immediately preceded by one of the
#      exact same trusted consumer shapes the sibling masking passes above
#      already trust: `--search`/`--arg NAME`/`--argjson NAME` (the
#      strip_literal_text() flag set — also tolerating the escaped-quote
#      exact-phrase wrapping `--search "\"$q\""` in addition to the plain
#      `--search "$q"` shape, #7288), directly after
#      grep/egrep/fgrep/rg/jq/check-duplicate.sh (the
#      mask_catastrophic_positional_args() command set), OR interpolated
#      anywhere inside a still-open `echo`/`printf` quoted argument (#6069)
#      — e.g. `echo "=== $q ==="`, the narrated-progress-heading shape
#      CLAUDE.md's own Guard-Decision Telemetry Review section pairs with a
#      `--search "$q"` lookup in the very same loop body, and the shape
#      actually observed recurring in `.loom/logs/guard-decisions.log`.
#      Unlike the grep/jq case (which requires `$var` to BE the whole
#      positional argument), the echo/printf check only requires the
#      variable to sit inside an argument whose quote is still open when
#      `$var` is reached — `echo`/`printf` never execute their arguments as
#      shell syntax, so any position inside an already-open quoted span
#      carries the identical safety rationale. A single occurrence in ANY
#      other context (bare command-position use, `eval "$var"`, an
#      UNQUOTED `echo $var`, etc.) aborts masking for that loop entirely —
#      fail closed, not partial. Known accepted gap: `printf '%s' "$var"`
#      (var in a SECOND, separate argument after a complete format-string
#      argument) is NOT covered — the still-open-quote check below only
#      sees the argument immediately following the command name, so that
#      shape stays fail-closed like any other unrecognized consumer;
#      `printf "text $var text"` (var interpolated directly in the one
#      format-string argument) IS covered. #7515 adds one more still-open-
#      quote shape, this time for `jq` specifically: `jq -r --arg p "XX"
#      'select(.pattern == $p) | .ts'` — the loop variable's TEXT (`$p`)
#      appears inside jq's own single-quoted FILTER-SCRIPT argument, where
#      it is a jq-language variable reference (bound by `--arg p "XX"` to
#      the literal string `"XX"`, never the outer loop variable's value) —
#      not a bash variable expansion at all, since it sits inside a
#      single-quoted bash argument bash never expands. The existing
#      grep/jq case above only recognizes `$var` immediately following
#      jq/grep/etc. (optionally after short flags) as the ENTIRE quoted
#      positional argument; it does not tolerate `--arg NAME "VALUE"` pairs
#      between the command and the final quoted script the way this new
#      check does, nor does it tolerate `$var` appearing mid-argument
#      (only at the very start). This new check is scoped narrowly to
#      `jq` followed by short flags and/or `--arg`/`--argjson NAME "VALUE"`
#      pairs, then a still-open quoted argument — mirroring the echo/printf
#      still-open-quote rationale, not a blanket loosening of the jq/grep
#      trusted-consumer set.
#
# Only when every check passes are the word-list literals masked, using the
# same inertness floor as every other pass in this file: a span containing
# `$(` or a backtick is left unmasked so command-substitution smuggling
# still reaches the raw scan.

# Mask a WHOLE-LINE `#`-prefixed shell comment (issue #6394) from the

# `# aws s3 rb mentioned here only, single line comment`, the exact shape
# this repo's own Auditor "Guard-Decision Telemetry Review" standing policy,
# #3898, produces while reporting on `.loom/logs/guard-decisions.log`) no
# longer hard-denies. A physical line whose first non-whitespace character is
# `#` is NEVER live shell syntax to any interpreter — bash, the outer shell,
# or an inner `sh -c`/heredoc-fed interpreter all treat it as a no-op comment
# — so dropping such a line can never hide a real invocation. Reproduced
# twice, single-line and multi-line, in #6394's own filing.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT a reuse of COMMAND_NO_COMMENT / mask_comment(): that
# working copy is explicitly reserved for the ASK/DDL tier only (see the
# "COMMENT-STRIPPED WORKING COPY" note further below in this file) — a
# missed ASK there is an accepted risk, but the catastrophic tier is kept
# strictly stricter so a missed BLOCK can never happen from a shared masking
# pass. This function is a SEPARATE, narrower primitive built solely for
# ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS, with its own, more conservative safety contract:
#
#   1. WHOLE-LINE ONLY: a line is masked only when the ENTIRE line (after
#      stripping leading whitespace) is a comment — i.e. the `#` is the
#      first non-whitespace character on that physical line. A TRAILING
#      comment on a line that also carries real command text (e.g.
#      `aws s3 rb bucket  # decommission`) is deliberately left untouched —
#      unlike mask_comment(), which strips those too — because there is no
#      way to redact the trailing span without touching the command text
#      immediately before it on the same line; scoping to whole-line-only
#      keeps the safety argument for this tier simple and obviously correct.
#      KNOWN ACCEPTED GAP, same posture as every other approximation in this
#      file: a whole-line comment that additionally quotes a catastrophic
#      phrase as a TRAILING comment on a real command's own line is not
#      unmasked by this pass and stays hard-denied (mirrors the accepted-gap
#      convention documented on mask_catastrophic_var_assignment() above).
#   2. QUOTE-AWARE: tracks single-/double-quote state across the WHOLE
#      (possibly multi-line) buffer exactly like mask_comment() does, so a
#      `#` that merely LOOKS like a line-start because it sits on its own
#      physical line, but is actually still inside an unterminated quoted
#      span from a PRIOR line, is never treated as a comment — it stays
#      fully visible to the raw scan and still denies. Same accepted
#      simplification as mask_comment()/mask_gt(): no backslash-escaped-quote
#      modeling.
#   3. HEREDOC-CONSERVATIVE: fails closed (does nothing) for the WHOLE buffer
#      whenever a `<<` heredoc redirect appears anywhere in it, rather than
#      attempting to reason about heredoc body boundaries or interpreter-fed
#      vs. plain-data heredocs. This deliberately mirrors (by NOT touching
#      anything) mask_heredoc_bodies_selective()'s interpreter-fed exclusion
#      further below: a `#`-looking line inside an interpreter-fed heredoc
#      body (`bash <<EOF ... EOF`) stays fully visible and still denies,
#      exactly like a plain (non-interpreter) heredoc body line does today.

    # would still ASK (never silently allow) on IAM deletion, and a headless
    # sweep still effectively blocks (an ASK with no human to answer denies;
    # see defaults/docs/guard-hooks.md). The remaining aws forms below stay
    # ungated catastrophic denies — a hard safety floor (#3593): mass object /
    # bucket deletion (`s3 rm --recursive`, `s3 rb`) and stack teardown
    # (`cloudformation delete-stack`) were not part of the rotation incident and

# substring scans above, it does not need strip_literal_text()'s quoted-value
# redaction to avoid false-positiving on prose. Scanning the redacted copy
# would in fact silently BREAK this rule: strip_literal_text() replaces a
# quoted value's entire inner text (including a leading `@`) with `X`s, so
# `gh pr comment 123 --body "@/tmp/x"` would come out of redaction as
# `--body "XXXXXXXXX"` — no `@` left to match. The unquoted form
# (`--body @/tmp/x`) is untouched by redaction either way, so a naive
# implementation that only smoke-tests the unquoted shape can look correct
# while silently missing the quoted shape actually seen in the field.
#
# The `@` must be followed by a path-shaped character (`/`, `.`, or `~`) —
# every real incident/test case is an absolute or relative path
# (`@/tmp/...`, `@./relative/path`, `@~/home/path`). A bare `@word` right
# after the opening quote is an @mention addressed to a reviewer (e.g.
# `--body "@reviewer Could you clarify..."`, the shape doctor.md's own

# simply did not cover the shape):
#

# denied — i.e. the deny above actively invites this bypass.
#
# An unconditional deny on `--body "$VAR"` would be far too broad: a legitimate
# `--body "$SUMMARY"` carrying review prose has the identical shape. So this
# rule CORRELATES instead — it denies only when the SAME command both
#   (a) assigns a PATH-SHAPED `@…` value to a shell variable, and
#   (b) passes that same variable as the --body/-b value.
# That combination has no legitimate use, and `--body "$SUMMARY"` (no @path
# assignment anywhere in the command) is untouched.

# than a widening of GH_COMMENT_BODY_AT_PATTERN above. #4577 is an open fix to
# that same regex for the OPPOSITE failure direction (bare `@mention` reply
# prose false-positived); keeping the two rules on separate lines means neither
# fix can regress or textually conflict with the other. For the same reason
# GH_AT_PATHISH requires actual path shape (an explicit `/`, `~/`, `./`, `../`
# prefix, or a text-file extension), so bare `@mention` / `@org/team` prose
# never matches it — this rule cannot widen #4577's false-positive surface.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT (by construction): a variable assigned in an EARLIER Bash call is
# invisible in a single PreToolUse payload, and no static inspection can reach

    # On `gh api`, ONLY `-F`/`--field` gives `@<path>` its read-from-file
    # meaning. `-f`/`--raw-field` is a plain string parameter with no file
    # expansion, so `gh api … -f body=@/tmp/review.md` posts the literal string
    # `@/tmp/review.md` as the comment body — byte-for-byte the same silent data
    # loss as the #4523 shape, on a surface that rule never inspected.
    #
    # CASE-SENSITIVE on purpose (grep -qE, NOT -qiE): `-i` would make `-f` match
    # the documented CORRECT alternative `-F body=@path` and deny it. The
    # leading whitespace anchor before the flag is likewise load-bearing —
    # without it, `-f` matches inside `--field` (the long form of `-F`) and
    # denies that too. GH_AT_PATHISH keeps `-f body="@mention …"` prose allowed.
    #
    # ENDPOINT SCOPE (#4685): this pattern was never anchored to a
    # `/comments` endpoint — it matches `gh api <any-endpoint> ... -f
    # body=@path` regardless of path — so it already covers `gh api
    # repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}` (issue PATCH) and
    # `repos/{o}/{r}/pulls/{n}` (PR PATCH) exactly as it covers
    # `.../issues/{n}/comments`. Confirmed via the test suite's new
    # non-comments-endpoint case; no widening was needed here.

    # HEREDOC-MASKED SCAN (#5181, refined #5198): this check used to grep raw

    # body=@x ... EOF`, nothing of which executes) tripped the same
    # catastrophic-tier deny as a live invocation. Reuses
    # mask_heredoc_bodies_selective() (#5198, built on the mask_heredoc_bodies()
    # primitive from #5000; as of #5351 extract_write_targets() also uses this
    # _selective() variant) to build a
    # heredoc-body-blanked working copy and scans THAT instead. Built lazily
    # (only when '<<' is present, mirroring the COMMAND_NO_COMMENT
    # `#`-present hot-path guard below) and scoped to just this one check;
    # every other rule in this file keeps reading raw $COMMAND /

    # "narrows, never widens" test at

# ASK-TIER WORKING COPY (#3756) — comment-stripped AND literal-text redacted.
#
# The ASK_PATTERNS loop below needs BOTH narrowings the catastrophic tier's two
# copies provide separately: COMMAND_NO_COMMENT's `#`-comment stripping AND
# strip_literal_text()'s quoted-flag-value redaction (the #3679 fix the ask tier
# never received). Building the ask copy from COMMAND_NO_COMMENT (not raw
# $COMMAND) preserves the comment-stripping the ask tier already relied on, then
# redacts --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment values so an ask-phrase quoted
# inside such a value (e.g. `gh pr comment --body "…gh issue close…"`) no longer
# false-asks. The strip only runs when a text-carrying flag is present, keeping
# it off the hot path. Never feeds the catastrophic scan (that keeps reading the
# raw command), so this can only NARROW an ask, never miss a hard deny.
#
# POSITIONAL-ARGUMENT MASKING (#5235): strip_literal_text() above is keyed
# ONLY on named-flag presence, so a script with a purely POSITIONAL
# signature — e.g. `./.loom/scripts/check-duplicate.sh TITLE DESCRIPTION`
# (no flags at all) — never triggered it, leaving its free-text TITLE/
# DESCRIPTION arguments scanned unmasked. This is the same class of gap
# #5155/#5160 already fixed for guard-loom-workflow.sh's gh-pr-merge-redirect
# scan. mask_ask_positional_args() (defined above, a deliberate near-
# duplicate of that fix, with a narrower allowlist — see its header comment
# for why grep/rg are deliberately excluded here) masks quoted positional
# arguments to check-duplicate.sh BEFORE the flag-keyed strip above runs, so
# a dedup check whose prose quotes an ask-phrase (e.g. "git stash pop") as
# inert text no longer false-asks on stash-scope:main-checkout,
# force-op:protected, or any other ASK_PATTERNS entry. Gated on the same
# command-name substring the awk allowlist matches, keeping it off the hot
# path for the vast majority of commands that never invoke it.
COMMAND_ASK_SCAN="$COMMAND_NO_COMMENT"
# HEREDOC-BODY MASKING (#5779): none of the narrowings above touch a
# single-quoted heredoc BODY -- e.g. `cat > /tmp/x.md <<'EOF' ... git reset
# --hard ... EOF` -- since that shape carries no --body/-m/etc. flag and is
# not a check-duplicate.sh positional argument either. That heredoc body is
# exactly as inert as a single-quoted string literal (no interpolation,
# nothing executes), so it should not be scanned by the force-op/stash-scope
# ASK_PATTERNS below any more than a quoted string is. Mirrors the
# catastrophic tier's "HEREDOC-MASKED SCAN" (#5181/#5198) above: reuse
# mask_heredoc_bodies_selective() to blank inert heredoc bodies while
# leaving an INTERPRETER-fed heredoc (`bash <<EOF`, `sh -s <<EOF`, ...)
# visible, since that body is genuinely live code (KNOWN LIMITATIONS #1).
# Gated on literal '<<' presence, keeping it off the hot path for the vast
# majority of commands with no heredoc at all. Narrows only: a real,
# non-heredoc force-op/stash invocation is untouched and still asks, even
# sitting in the same multi-line command as an unrelated heredoc.
#
# UNQUOTED-DELIMITER SECOND PASS (#6056): mask_heredoc_bodies_selective()
# deliberately leaves every UNQUOTED-delimiter body (`cat <<EOF`, no quotes
# around EOF) visible, because the outer shell expands `$(...)`/backticks
# inside it (#5781). Correct as a default, but it made the routine Judge
# idiom `gh pr comment N --body "$(cat <<EOF ... EOF)"` false-ask
# force-op:protected whenever the comment prose quotes `git push
# --force-with-lease` as advice to a human -- an unanswerable stall in a
# headless run. mask_unquoted_cat_heredoc_bodies() (defined above, mirroring
# guard-loom-workflow.sh mask_cat_heredoc_bodies()) closes exactly that shape:
# it masks an unquoted cat-heredoc ONLY when the capture is confined to a
# text-data flag value AND the body is proven free of `$(`/unescaped-backtick
# expansion, so a body that could actually execute something stays visible and
# still asks. Runs SECOND so the quoted-delimiter pass (and its interpreter
# carve-out) keeps full authority over the shapes it already handles.

# (guards.cloudCli), not the catastrophic tier's ungated denial floor -- so it

# SYSTEM-LIFECYCLE + CLOUD-CLI DELETE (segment-parsed, command-word anchored)
#
# The system-lifecycle commands (halt/reboot/poweroff/shutdown/init 0/init 6)
# and the az/gcloud cloud-delete CLIs are far too common as ordinary prose,

# messages ("...the box will halt", "...after a reboot event"). A pure regex
# tweak cannot separate `sudo halt` (a real command) from `will halt` (prose)
# because both are "<word> halt".
#
# So we segment-parse instead, mirroring extract_rm_targets(): split the command
# on ; | & && || and newline, strip a leading sudo/env wrapper from each segment,
# and deny only when a segment's *command word* (first token) is exactly a
# lifecycle word — or is `az`/`gcloud` with a `delete` subcommand token. This
# distinguishes `sudo halt` (command word = halt) from `will halt` (command word
# = echo/other) and from `--instance-initiated-shutdown-behavior` (not a command
# word at all). The scan runs against COMMAND_NO_COMMENT so a lifecycle/cloud
# word sitting in a trailing comment is already gone. The catastrophic

#     NOT treated as a local rm: the wrapper's command word is `ssh`/`scp`, not
#     `rm`, so no local target is emitted and the local scope check is skipped.
#     The ALWAYS_BLOCK catastrophic patterns above still scan the whole string,

# whose value is, in fact, provably rooted under /tmp (or $TMPDIR) — mktemp's
# own contract with no output-redirecting flags. This is a NEW resolution
# step, deliberately NOT built on resolve_var()/record_assign() (#4881,
# #6152): that pair only ever substitutes the LITERAL text following `=`
# (after quote-stripping), so a command-substitution RHS like `$(mktemp -d)`
# would still start with `$` and stay unresolved even if this path called it.
#
# rm_scope_mktemp_same_command_safe() returns success (0) ONLY when:
#   1. The rm target, after stripping at most one layer of surrounding quotes,
#      is a BARE `$NAME` or `${NAME}` reference — nothing else in the token
#      (a suffix like `$NAME/sub` is deliberately excluded; fail closed).
#   2. Scanning every ;/&/&&/||-separated segment of the SAME command text
#      for a `NAME=...` assignment whose entire segment is EXACTLY
#      `NAME=$(mktemp -d)` or `NAME=$(mktemp)` (optionally the same forms
#      double-quoted) — the plain, default-temp-root-rooted invocations only.
#      A custom template/prefix (`mktemp -d /other/dir/XXXXXX`,
#      `mktemp --tmpdir=/other/dir`, …) never matches this exact-string test,
#      so it is excluded from the fast path and falls through to today's
#      fail-closed deny (routine complexity: prefer excluding an unusual
#      mktemp shape over guessing its output root, #6520).
#   3. Exactly ONE assignment to NAME exists anywhere in the command, and it
#      is the safe form above. TWO OR MORE assignments to NAME — even a
#      second, differently-shaped one appearing AFTER the safe mktemp
#      assignment — poison the resolution and fail closed: the guard cannot
#      tell which assignment's value the shell will see at the `rm` word, so
#      ambiguity must never resolve to an allow.
#
# On success, the caller treats the target as a proven /tmp-or-$TMPDIR-rooted
# path and skips BOTH the unresolved-var deny AND the string-prefix scope
# check below it — the raw `$CWD/$target` concatenation used by that check
# still contains the literal, un-substituted `$NAME` text (this is a
# tokenizer, not a shell evaluator) and cannot be trusted for anything beyond
# the narrow proof made here.
#
# DECOY-HEREDOC BYPASS (#6549): the awk body below processes its `cmdtext`
# argument one PHYSICAL LINE at a time with no heredoc-body awareness of its
# own, so passing it the raw (heredoc-unmasked) command text let an attacker
# set the REAL value of `NAME` via a shape this scan's exact `NAME=` prefix
# match never sees (e.g. `export NAME=$(malicious_command)`), issue a live
# `rm -rf "$NAME"`, then plant an inert, never-executed decoy
# `NAME=$(mktemp -d)` line inside a heredoc body later in the same command
# purely to make `total == 1 && safe == 1` come out true. The caller
# (rm-scope SCOPE CHECK, below) now passes a heredoc-body-masked working
# copy — see its own `COMMAND_RM_MKTEMP_SCAN` comment for why it masks
# unconditionally (every heredoc shape, including an interpreter-fed one)
# rather than reusing `COMMAND_ASK_SCAN`'s narrower, interpreter-aware
# masking.

# `rm` targets —
#   tmp=$(mktemp -d) && mkdir -p "$tmp/sub" && cat > "$tmp/sub/out.txt"
#   TMPGUARD=$(mktemp) && ... > "$TMPGUARD"
# — was equally unresolvable here: resolve_var()/resolve_var_q() only ever
# substitute the LITERAL text following `=`, so a command-substitution RHS
# like `$(mktemp -d)` still starts with `$` and stays unresolved (same root
# cause documented on rm_scope_mktemp_same_command_safe() above). Because a
# write target routinely carries a SUFFIX after the captured scratch dir
# (`"$tmp/sub/out.txt"`, not just a bare `"$tmp"`), this sibling — unlike the
# rm-scope original, which only ever proves a BARE `$NAME` reference safe —
# additionally accepts a `/`-prefixed suffix after the variable reference.
#
# _wt_write_mktemp_leading_var() returns success (0), with the variable name
# in `_WT_WRITE_VARNAME` and the (possibly empty) `/`-prefixed suffix in
# `_WT_WRITE_SUFFIX`, ONLY when the write target, after stripping at most one
# layer of surrounding quotes, is a bare `$NAME`/`${NAME}` reference OR that
# same reference immediately followed by `/<rest>` — nothing else in the
# token. wt_write_mktemp_same_command_safe() then applies:
#
#   1. The SAME exact-string same-command mktemp scan rm-scope uses (only a
#      SAME command NAME=$(mktemp -d) / NAME=$(mktemp) — optionally
#      double-quoted — assignment counts; a custom template/prefix
#      (`mktemp -d /other/dir/XXXXXX`, `mktemp --tmpdir=/other/dir`, …) never
#      matches this exact-string test and falls through to today's
#      fail-closed deny) and the SAME ambiguity rule (two or more assignments
#      to NAME anywhere in the command poison the resolution and fail closed).
#   2. A NEW safety condition the rm-scope original does not need, precisely
#      because it never allows a suffix at all: any `..` path-traversal
#      component in the suffix (`/../`, or a suffix that IS or ends in `/..`)
#      fails closed. mktemp's own OUTPUT PATH is never known to this static
#      scanner — only that it is freshly created and /tmp-or-$TMPDIR-rooted —
#      so a `..` in the suffix could walk back out of that unknown directory
#      to an unknown number of levels, potentially back into a protected
#      worktree/checkout. Excluding any `..` component keeps the same
#      "provably safe or fail closed" guarantee the exact-string mktemp match
#      itself relies on.
#
# On success the caller treats the write as landing inside a freshly created
# scratch directory outside every worktree and skips the
# `worktree-write-confinement-unresolved-var` deny for this target — mirrors
# the rm-scope caller's own "no need to re-run any further scope check"
# treatment, since a fresh mktemp path can never coincide with the main

# rm-scope SAME-COMMAND LITERAL-PATH RESOLUTION (#6676)
#
# rm_scope_mktemp_same_command_safe() (above) proves ONLY the exact-string
# `$(mktemp -d)`/`$(mktemp)` same-command RHS shape safe — a same-command
# assignment of a LITERAL absolute path (`FARM=/tmp/nofile-bin-6662; rm -rf
# "$FARM"`) never matches that exact-string test and previously fell straight
# through to the fail-closed `rm-scope-unresolved-var` deny even though the
# value is a provably static, non-command-substitution literal.
#
# rm_scope_literal_same_command_resolve() is a SIBLING fast path, not a
# replacement for the mktemp one: it reuses record_assign()'s DQ/SQ-aware
# quote-stripping logic (one layer of surrounding quotes stripped, #4881/
# #6152) to resolve a same-command `NAME=<value>` assignment, then judges the
# result:
#
#   1. Exactly ONE assignment to NAME exists anywhere in the SAME command
#      text — mirrors the mktemp fast path's own ambiguity rule (its own doc
#      comment, point 3, above): a second assignment to the same name — even
#      an identical or otherwise-safe-looking one — poisons the resolution
#      and fails closed, since the guard cannot tell which assignment's value
#      the shell sees at the `rm` word.
#   2. The (quote-stripped) RHS is a PURE LITERAL absolute path: starts with
#      `/`, and contains neither `$` nor a backtick anywhere — so a RHS that
#      itself still carries an unresolved expansion (`NAME="$OTHER/sub"`,
#      `NAME=$(cmd)`, `` NAME=`cmd` ``) is rejected rather than trusted as a
#      literal (fail closed).
#
# LITERAL SUFFIX AFTER THE VARIABLE (#6805): the target does NOT have to be a
# bare `$NAME`. The overwhelmingly common real-world shapes in the guard
# decision log are a variable followed by a literal path suffix —
# `rm -rf "$WT/.snapshots"`, `rm -f "$WORKTREE_ABS"/.merge_file_*` — which the
# original #6676 pass rejected via _rm_scope_bare_var_name()'s bare-reference-
# only test and denied at the catastrophic tier even though the value is a
# static literal. _rm_scope_var_ref_split() (below) accepts `$NAME<suffix>` /
# `${NAME}<suffix>` in any quoting, and the suffix is re-appended to the
# resolved literal before the caller's scope check runs. This mirrors
# resolve_var() in _VARRESOLVE_AWK, the write-confinement guard's shared
# same-command resolver (#4881/#6152), which has always carried the trailing
# `rest` of the token through the substitution.
#
# On success this prints the resolved literal absolute path on stdout and
# returns 0. Unlike the mktemp fast path (which is unconditionally
# /tmp-or-$TMPDIR-rooted and lets the CALLER skip the scope check entirely),
# a literal path can resolve anywhere — the CALLER is responsible for
# re-running the normal rm-scope checks (the top-level catastrophic-path deny
# AND the repo/worktree/tmp IN_SCOPE check) against the resolved path, so it
# is judged exactly like an equivalent literal `rm -rf /that/path` would be.
# That is what keeps the suffix extension a FALSE-POSITIVE refinement rather
# than a relaxation: `WT=/etc; rm -rf "$WT/foo"` resolves to `/etc/foo` and is
# still denied by the ordinary out-of-scope check, and any `..` in the suffix
# is collapsed by the caller's normalize_abs_path() before that check.

# rooted at the path root, or when the suffix is not a pure literal.
#
# Operates on mark_expandable_dollars()'s normalized shape (#4921) rather than
# hand-rolling a second quote parser: that helper strips quote characters,
# applies backslash escapes, and replaces every EXPANDABLE `$` with SOH (0x01)
# while leaving a LITERAL `$` (single-quoted or backslash-escaped — a file
# genuinely named `$X`) alone. So `"$WT/.snapshots"`, `"$WT"/.snapshots` and
# `$WT/.snapshots` all normalize to the same shape, and quoting cannot be used
# to dodge the tests below.
#
# Fail-closed conditions (each returns 1, leaving today's deny in place):
#   - the token does not START with an expandable `$` (a variable in a
#     non-root component, e.g. `/foo/$BAR`, is not this function's business —
#     the caller only reaches here for root-rooted unresolved targets);
#   - the suffix contains another expandable `$` (SOH), a literal `$`, or a
#     backtick — i.e. anything this single-pass resolver cannot prove static;
#   - the suffix is non-empty and does not begin with `/` — a shape like
#     `"$WT".bak` names a SIBLING of the resolved path rather than something
#     under it, so it is excluded from the fast path rather than guessed.

# extract_write_targets() — Bash-tool write-idiom target extraction (#4178).
#
# Emits one "<cwd>\t<target>" line (TAB-separated, US separator 0x1f — mirrors
# parse_force_ops' SEP convention) per recognized write idiom found in $1:
#   - `>` / `>>` redirection, bare or fd-prefixed (`2>file`), attached
#     (`>file`) or spaced (`> file`). A dup-to-fd form (`>&1`, `2>&1`) is
#     recognized and EXCLUDED — it never writes a file.
#   - `tee <file>...`            — every non-flag argument is a target.
#   - `sed -i ... <script> <file>...` — only when an -i/-i* flag is present;
#     the FIRST non-flag argument is assumed to be the sed script, the rest
#     are file targets. Exactly one non-flag argument is genuinely ambiguous
#     (could be an -f scriptfile with no positional file yet) and is SKIPPED
#     rather than guessed — allow on uncertainty, never deny on uncertainty.
#   - `cp` / `mv ... <dest>`     — the LAST non-flag argument (the common
#     `cp/mv src... dest` shape).
#
# In the three idiom scans above (NOT the `>`/`>>` scan, which has its own
# operator detection), a `<` stdin redirection is recognized and EXCLUDED
# (#5369): neither the operator token (`<`, `0<`, `</path`) nor the file a
# bare `<` reads FROM is a write target. Skipping it fixes both a false DENY
# (phantom `<repo>/<` targets on `tee f < in`) and, for `cp`/`mv` — whose
# destination is the LAST non-flag token — a false ALLOW where a trailing
# `< in` displaced the real destination. See the inline comment at the scan.
#
# Likewise, a same-line NUMBERED-FD output redirect (`2>/dev/null`, `2>&1`,
# `1>/tmp/x`, ...) is recognized and EXCLUDED from those same three idiom
# scans (#6326): neither the operator token nor (for the bare/spaced form)
# the file it writes TO is treated as an extra tee/sed-i/cp/mv file operand.
# Without this, a trailing `2>/dev/null` on an otherwise-harmless
# `cp src /tmp/dst 2>/dev/null` was misread as the cp/mv destination itself
# (the LAST non-flag token), producing a bogus relative "target" that joined
# against cwd and false-denied as a worktree-confinement bypass even though
# the command never wrote inside the main checkout. A bare `>`/`>>` with NO
# leading digit is deliberately left OUTSIDE this exclusion (unchanged
# behavior) — see the inline comment at the scan.
#
# $2 seeds the starting cwd. A `cd <path>` segment updates cwd for LATER
# segments of the SAME command (so `cd <worktree> && echo x > f` resolves the
# relative target against the worktree, not the hook's cwd) — global awk
# variable `curcwd`, threaded across the per-line pattern-action block exactly
# like parse_force_ops threads `cpath` via `git -C`. As of #7294, the `cd`
# argument itself is first run through resolve_var() (mirroring
# parse_force_ops' own #6152 fix) — so a same-command `NAME=value` assignment
# resolved through `cd "$NAME/sub"` feeds a `$`-free, RESOLVED cwd into LATER
# relative-path writes, instead of leaving `$NAME` literally embedded in
# curcwd and failing those writes closed as unresolved.
#
# NOT a full shell parser: like parse_force_ops / extract_rm_targets, splitting
# a segment into tokens starts from plain whitespace splitting. Unlike those
# two, a QUOTED argument containing a literal space is NOT mis-split here: the
# split runs against mask_ws()'s output (#4934), which replaces whitespace
# INSIDE a quoted span with a non-whitespace placeholder before
# `split(seg, toks, /[ \t]+/)` runs, so a quoted path with an embedded space
# (e.g. `echo x > '/main/checkout/evil file.sh'`) yields exactly ONE token —
# unmask_ws() restores the real whitespace bytes in that token afterward. The
# `>`/`>>` redirection scan below is quote-aware in a second, independent way
# (#4245) via mask_gt() — a `>` inside a quoted argument (e.g. `gh issue
# create --body "... env > config > default ..."`) is never treated as a
# redirection operator, regardless of whether the caller's literal-text
# redaction (next paragraph) already removed it. The caller ALSO feeds this
# the ASK-tier working copy (COMMAND_ASK_SCAN — comment-stripped AND
# literal-text-redacted, i.e. --body/-m/--title/--notes/--comment values are
# replaced with same-length placeholder text) as a second, independent
# narrowing so a `>` that merely appears INSIDE such a quoted value (e.g.
# `git commit -m "a > b"`) cannot manufacture a phantom target even in the
# (non-`>`) tee/sed/cp/mv target-extraction paths below. Any remaining false
# positive resolves to, at worst, an extra deny on a target that isn't really
# a write (safe direction) or a missed target (also safe — the fail-open
# contract this file uses everywhere: ambiguity never widens a deny).
#
# The `cd <path>` tracking now tilde/$HOME-expands its argument via
# expand_cd_arg() (#5315, defined with _QSPLIT_AWK above) — see that function's
# header for the exact expansion rules and the quoted/escaped/`~user` fallbacks.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# #5315 DECISION (recorded, NOT implemented in this pass) — two deliberate
# scope calls, documented here so a later reader does not mistake either for an
# oversight:
#
#   1. `~user` / `~user/rest` in a tracked `cd` argument is left UNRESOLVED
#      (joined repo-relative, i.e. classified in-tree / denied) rather than
#      resolved to another account's home. awk cannot look a user's home up via
#      getent/dscl without building a shell command string around an
#      attacker-influenced username token — a command-injection surface this
#      guard must not open. The write-TARGET side (expand_leading_tilde, #4382)
#      can afford that lookup because it runs in bash with the username passed
#      as a non-eval'd argv element; the cd-argument side runs inside awk and
#      cannot. Leaving it repo-relative is the fail-CLOSED direction (a
#      genuinely out-of-tree `cd ~alice && …` write stays denied, never
#      silently allowed), matching this file's `cd -` / bare-`cd` convention.
#      The overwhelmingly-common current-user forms (`~`, `~/rest`, `$HOME`,
#      `$HOME/rest` — the actual #5315 report) ARE expanded.
#
#   2. EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS-class runtime state (the daemon's own gitignored
#      files — `.loom/.daemon.pid` et al., authoritative list in
#      loom-daemon/src/init/post_init.rs) is NOT exempted from Bash write
#      confinement. As of this change no such exemption exists in either
#      guard-destructive-generic.sh or guard-worktree-paths.sh; adding one is
#      net-new policy, and CLAUDE.md documents an "ungated denial floor" that no
#      toggle may bypass, so a gitignore-aware carve-out risks widening that
#      floor into an allow if scoped even slightly too broadly. The concrete
#      #5315 report was a false POSITIVE caused entirely by defect (1) above
#      (the literal-`~` mis-join), which this change fixes directly — an
#      operator maintaining `.loom/.daemon.pid` runs from the primary checkout,
#      not a builder worktree, so once the path resolves correctly it is a
#      routine main-checkout write and the confinement question is orthogonal.
#      Deferred to a dedicated follow-up so the exemption's blast radius can be
#      designed against the denial floor deliberately rather than bolted on
#      alongside a canonicalization fix. See #5315 for the deferral rationale.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# SAME-COMMAND VARIABLE RESOLUTION (#4881): a write-idiom target whose token
# is `$NAME`/`${NAME}[...]` is not itself a real path — the real shell
# substitutes it from that variable's value before the redirect/tee/sed/cp/mv
# ever runs. This tokenizer previously treated such a token as a literal
# relative path and cwd-prefixed it, manufacturing a phantom repo-relative
# target (e.g. `SCRATCH=/private/tmp/.../scratchpad` on one line, then `... >
# $SCRATCH/out.txt` on the next, was denied as a worktree-isolation bypass
# even though the real target resolves to /private/tmp, far outside the
# repo). `resolve_var()` below performs the ONE unambiguous, narrow piece of
# this: when the SAME command text contains a `NAME=value` assignment (no
# embedded whitespace in `value`, optionally single/double-quoted) earlier in
# the stream, later `$NAME`/`${NAME}` leading a write target is substituted
# with that value. Threaded via the awk global `varmap`, exactly like `curcwd`
# above. The assignment scan recognizes every ordinary shell assignment
# position, not just a segment that is exactly one bare `NAME=value`:
#   NAME=value                       (bare)
#   export/readonly/declare/typeset/local [-flags] NAME=value [NAME2=value2]
#   A=1 B=2                          (several assignments in one segment)
#   A=1 some-command args…           (env-var prefix — A recorded, then the
#                                     REST of the segment is still scanned as
#                                     a command for write idioms)
#
# CONFLICTING ASSIGNMENTS ARE UNRESOLVABLE (#4914 review): the scan is not
# control-flow aware — qsplit() flattens `||`/`&&`/`;` into plain segments — so
# a name assigned two DIFFERENT values in one command
# (`A=<repo>/defaults/hooks || A=/tmp/outside`) is poisoned to the unresolvable
# sentinel rather than resolved to whichever branch happens to come last in the
# token stream. See record_assign() below.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED ON UNRESOLVABLE (#4914 review): a `$NAME` with NO matching
# assignment, or a token starting with `$` that is not a bare variable
# reference at all (`$(...)` command substitution, `${VAR:-default}`, `$1`,
# an inherited/sourced env var, …), is UNRESOLVABLE. It is NEVER guessed —
# and it is NEVER skipped either. It falls back to the PRE-#4881 behavior:
# the raw token is treated as a literal (repo-relative) path, so a write that
# lands inside the main checkout still denies with the ordinary
# `worktree-write-confinement` tag. Skipping an unresolvable target would
# hand every un-parsed assignment shape a free #4178 worktree-isolation
# bypass (`export SNEAK=<repo>/defaults/hooks; echo x > $SNEAK/evil.sh`), so
# this fix only ever RELAXES the one literally-resolvable case it can prove
# lands outside the repo — it never flips the default for anything else. (The
# file's broader "ambiguity never widens a deny" contract is about not
# inventing NEW denies; preserving an EXISTING one is the conservative side.)

            # manufacture a phantom write target here but could silently

# expand_leading_tilde() — shell-accurate tilde expansion for write targets
# (#4382, same fix family as the quote-aware `>` scanning of #4245/#4289).
#
# extract_write_targets() (below) is a plain-whitespace/quote-aware TOKENIZER,
# not a shell evaluator — it never performs word expansions (tilde, variable,
# glob, ...). A raw token like `~/.local/bin/x` was therefore resolved as a
# REPO-RELATIVE path (cwd-prefixed) even though the real shell would expand it
# to "$HOME/.local/bin/x" before `cp`/`mv`/`tee`/`sed -i`/redirection ever see
# it — producing a false-positive worktree-confinement deny on a write that
# actually lands far outside the repo (#4382).
#
# This performs ONLY the narrow, unambiguous piece of shell word-expansion
# tilde-expansion applies to: an UNQUOTED, UNESCAPED tilde as the FIRST
# character of the token, i.e. exactly the shell-eligible positions:
#   ~/rest        -> "$HOME/rest"
#   ~             -> "$HOME"
#   ~user/rest    -> "<user's home>/rest"   (only if that user resolves)
#   ~user         -> "<user's home>"
#
# Because qsplit() (the shared tokenizer, #3755) copies a quoted span
# VERBATIM including its quote characters, and leaves a literal backslash
# untouched, a token whose raw text does not start with a bare `~` was NOT
# eligible for shell tilde-expansion and MUST stay untouched here:
#   '~/x'   -> starts with a quote char, shell never expands it (stays literal)
#   \~/x    -> starts with a literal backslash, shell never expands it either
#   foo~/x  -> tilde is not the leading character -- not an expansion position
# Any of these three cases falls through unchanged (echoed back as-is), which
# preserves the existing (correct) repo-relative/deny behavior for them.
#
# `~user` lookup uses getent (Linux) / dscl (macOS) with the username passed
# as a plain CLI argument (never eval'd/interpolated into a shell string) so a
# hostile username token cannot inject a command. If the user cannot be
# resolved on this host, the token is returned UNCHANGED (falls back to the
# existing repo-relative treatment) -- consistent with this file's fail-open
# contract: uncertainty here biases toward the (safe) deny path, never toward
# a silent new allow.

# extract_rm_targets() segments with qsplit(), which — like every
# quote-tracking scan in this file — is driven one PHYSICAL LINE at a time and
# has no memory of a `"` opened on an earlier line. So a heredoc BODY line
# inside `--body "$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF)"` was segmented as if it were live
# shell: the prose `Example payload: \`owner/name; rm -rf /\`` split on its
# `;` into a segment whose command word is `rm`, manufacturing the target
# ``/` `` and hard-denying a Judge comment that deletes nothing (observed on
# PR #4357). Same failure family as #5000's phantom write targets.
#
# #5216 closed that ONE shape (a `<flag> "$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF)"` value
# directly following a text-carrying flag) by scanning COMMAND_NO_LITERAL_TEXT
# — narrow on purpose at the time, mirroring the catastrophic
# ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS scan's own copy. But it left a SIBLING shape open
# (#6519): `cat <<'EOF' > /tmp/x.md … EOF` writing an inert example to a file,
# referenced LATER via `--body-file /tmp/x.md` (or any other non-substitution
# consumer) — no flag ever sits directly before the heredoc opener, so neither
# strip_literal_text() nor its mask_flag_cat_heredocs() helper ever sees it,
# and a heredoc body line whose own first word happens to be `rm` (e.g. a
# standalone "rm -rf /opt/vendor/important" example line in acceptance-
# criteria prose) still manufactured a phantom local `rm` segment and
# hard-denied a write that deletes nothing (reproduced against rjwalters/
# anvil#1073's shape). This is the exact same failure family
# parse_force_ops()/lifecycle_or_cloud_reason() already fixed by reading
# COMMAND_ASK_SCAN (comment-stripped AND heredoc-body-masked via
# mask_heredoc_bodies_selective()/mask_unquoted_cat_heredoc_bodies(), gated
# only on heredoc/flag PRESENCE, not on a specific flag+substitution shape) —
# extract_rm_targets() now matches that established pattern instead of
# growing its own narrower one. mask_heredoc_bodies_selective() masks ONLY a
# CLOSED, quoted-delimiter heredoc BODY and deliberately leaves an
# INTERPRETER-fed heredoc (`bash <<EOF`, `sh -s <<EOF`, `cat <<EOF | sh`, …)
# and everything OUTSIDE the heredoc untouched, so a REAL `rm -rf /` — bare,
# sudo-prefixed, after a `&&`, chained after a heredoc closes, inside an
# interpreter-fed heredoc, or smuggled through `bash -c '…'` / `-m "$(rm -rf
# /)"` — still reaches this check unchanged; only inert, provably-non-executing
# heredoc-body prose is newly excluded. Both `rm-protected-path` (unconditional)
# and `rm-scope-outside-repo` (guards.rmScope-gated) consume the same
# RM_TARGETS list built below, so this widening applies to both — matching
# lifecycle_or_cloud_reason()'s precedent of an unconditional deny already

# BASH-TOOL WRITE CONFINEMENT — worktree isolation for `>`/`>>`/tee/sed -i/
# cp/mv (issue #4178)
#
# guard-worktree-paths.sh confines Edit/Write tool calls to a builder's issue
# worktree, but the Bash tool has no equivalent confinement — a session denied
# on Edit/Write could fall back to a Bash write and land the same edit in the
# main checkout (the #4178 incident: sweep #4063 escaped this way and edited
# live guard hooks in the main checkout while its own worktree stayed clean).
#
# Gated by the SAME toggle as guard-worktree-paths.sh
# (guards.worktreeIsolation / LOOM_GUARD_WORKTREE_ISOLATION,
# worktree_isolation_guard_enabled() above) and only denies when a managed
# worktree actually exists somewhere for this repo — exactly the
# path_derived_allow() logic in guard-worktree-paths.sh, reimplemented here
# because this is a separate Bash-matcher hook with its own fail-open
# contract. A cheap substring pre-check keeps the segmenter off the hot path
# for the vast majority of Bash calls that contain none of the recognized
# write idioms at all.
#
# CARVE-OUT: read-only-by-role scratch staging in `dist/` (#6021). This
# block's threat model (above) is a session that HAS Write/Edit — a
# Builder/Doctor denied on the Edit/Write tool falling back to a Bash write
# to land the same edit in the main checkout. A role with NO Write/Edit tool
# at all was never the threat this guard defends against, and such a role
# also has no issue worktree to redirect to — the deny's own remediation
# ("cd into your issue worktree") is not actionable for it. Concretely: the
# Auditor validating the `worker-image-smoke` CI leg locally needs to stage
# the release binary at `dist/loom-daemon-<target>` (the Docker build
# context `docker/worker/Dockerfile`'s `LOOM_DAEMON_BIN` ARG documents, the
# same convention `.github/workflows/release.yml` uses for release assets)
# before running `docker build`, and had no way to do that without tripping
# this guard.
#
# Scoped narrowly on BOTH axes so this cannot widen into a general opt-out:
#   1. Role: LOOM_ROLE (set by role_runner/daemon dispatch, #4768) must
#      match _WT_READONLY_ROLES below — the allowlist of roles whose
#      `tools:` frontmatter in defaults/.claude/agents/loom-<role>.md grants
#      no Write/Edit tool (verified against that frontmatter at the time of
#      #6021: architect, auditor, champion, curator, guide, hermit, judge).
#      Builder and Doctor — the only two roles WITH Write/Edit — are
#      deliberately never in this list, and an unset/unrecognized LOOM_ROLE
#      (every interactive Builder/Doctor session, and any automation that
#      does not explicitly identify itself) fails CLOSED to the pre-existing
#      deny below. If a future role gains Write/Edit, its name must be
#      removed from this list.
#   2. Path: the write target must resolve inside `<main-checkout>/dist/`
#      specifically — a small, already-`.gitignore`d, well-known scratch
#      directory this repo's own release pipeline already treats as a
#      build-artifact staging area, NOT "anywhere outside the worktree."

    # LOOM_WORKTREE_PATH as a "this session is pinned to exactly this
    # worktree" declaration, set by a tmux/manual launcher that owns one
    # process per worktree. This block had no equivalent, so the SAME target
    # could be accepted through Edit/Write and denied through
    # `cp`/`mv`/`tee`/redirection — and a guard that blocks the well-behaved
    # form of a write it already permits elsewhere is exactly what pushes an
    # agent toward hunting for another tool, which is the behavior the #4178
    # confinement exists to discourage. The two guards now read the var
    # identically for the ALLOW half.
    #
    # Two deliberate differences from the sibling guard, both NARROWING:
    #   - ALLOW-ONLY. In guard-worktree-paths.sh the fast path is also
    #     exclusive: once the var is set, everything outside it is denied.
    #     This block has never confined Bash writes outside the repo at all
    #     (`/tmp` scratch, `~/.cache`, build outputs), so importing the deny
    #     half would be a large behavior change unrelated to this fix.
    #   - The var is IGNORED when it resolves to the main checkout root.
    #     "Pinned to the main checkout" is not a worktree pin, and honoring
    #     it would let one inherited env var silently switch the whole #4178

    #     guards.worktreeIsolation:false in .loom/config.json.

    # created with a plain `git worktree add` never carries one — harmless
    # while it sits OUTSIDE the main checkout (the containment test above
    # already lets it through), but a worktree nested UNDER the main checkout
    # (`<main>/.claude/worktrees/x`, the layout some repos document) matches
    # the main-root prefix test and gets denied even though git itself
    # considers it a separate working tree that shares nothing with the main
    # checkout's index or tracked files.
    #
    # So: consult `git worktree list --porcelain` and treat a target inside
    # any registered worktree OTHER than the main one as "not the main
    # checkout". The main worktree entry is excluded in both spellings, so
    # this can never turn into an allow for the checkout this block protects.
    #
    # TRUST BOUNDARY (#4245): this widens recognition from "worktrees Loom
    # created" to "worktrees git knows about" — a stray or deliberate
    # `git worktree add` elsewhere in the repo now gains the same treatment.
    # That is a real widening, and it is accepted knowingly: the sentinel was
    # never an authentication boundary (the deny message itself says the check
    # "cannot verify it belongs to the acting session", and `touch
    # .loom-managed` — not a write form this guard even scans — already forges
    # it), while the false positive it caused blocks a documented, legitimate
    # workflow. What is NOT widened: the main checkout's own working tree,
    # which is what #4178 protects, stays denied.

    # Resolved lazily and cached — the `git` call only runs for a write that
    # is otherwise about to be denied, and the parse itself forks nothing per

        #       prefix is pure invention. Denied regardless of where cwd is.
        #   (2) an expandable `$` appears in a DIRECTORY component of the
        #       resolved path (`> $A/evil`, `> ./$A/evil`, `cd $A && > f`)
        #       AND the known prefix — everything before the first `$`, i.e.
        #       the only part that is a real path — is inside the area this
        #       guard protects, or there is no usable known prefix at all
        #       (it is relative, or it normalizes to `/` as in
        #       `> /tmp/../$A/evil`). An unknown directory component under the

        #       test can see it.
        #
        # Deliberately NOT denied (no new false positives — these keep their
        # existing treatment):
        #   - a `$` only in the FINAL component (`> out-$STAMP.log`,
        #     `sed -i s/a/b/ src/$f`): the directory is fully known and really
        #     is cwd-relative, so the sentinel check (a) and the main-root
        #     containment test below are meaningful again.
        #   - a known prefix OUTSIDE the protected area (`> /tmp/$D/f.log`):
        #     the write lands where this guard protects nothing.
        #   - a LITERAL `$` the shell would never expand — inside a

# SERVICE-MANAGEMENT ASK — systemctl restart/stop/disable, segment-parsed,
# command-word anchored (#5214)
#
# These three verbs used to live in ASK_PATTERNS above as plain substring
# patterns anchored only by '(^|[;&|[:space:]])' (#3756) — a boundary that
# cannot distinguish a real shell separator from a whitespace character sitting
# INSIDE a quoted string literal. So a phrase like `systemctl restart` merely
# being quoted as SEARCH TEXT (a grep pattern, a jq filter, prose) still matched
# on its leading space, even though no such command was ever invoked:
#   grep -n "idle\|systemctl restart\|systemd\|relaunch\|--idle-shutdown" f.sh
#   jq -c 'select(.pattern | contains("systemctl"))' guard-decisions.log
#
# Mirrors lifecycle_or_cloud_reason()'s fix for the analogous halt/reboot/
# az-delete false positive: segment-parse the command with qsplit() (quote-aware,
# #3755) instead of scanning raw substrings, strip a leading sudo/env wrapper
# per segment, and ask ONLY when a segment's actual command word is `systemctl`
# AND its very next token is restart/stop/disable. A quoted `|` inside
# `grep`/`jq` arguments (no `$(`/backtick) is inert to qsplit(), so both example
# commands above stay a single `grep`/`jq` segment — command word never
# resolves to `systemctl` — and no longer false-ask. A genuine invocation
# (bare, after `;`/`&&`/`|`, or with a later quoted argument such as
# `systemctl restart "my service"`) still asks, since toks[1]/toks[2] are
# unaffected by trailing quoted content.
#
# Scoped narrowly to this one "Service management" ASK_PATTERNS block per
# #5214 — #5157/#5158 describe the same false-positive CLASS for other
# patterns but were judged too broad a fix to land autonomously; this is not
# an attempt at a general-purpose fix for the whole ASK_PATTERNS family.

# above — this segment-parses the command with qsplit() (quote-aware,
# #3755), strips a leading sudo/env wrapper per segment, and only inspects

# PRINTENV CREDENTIAL-NAME ASK — segment-parsed, name-allowlisted (#6245)
#
# The plain-substring ASK_PATTERNS entries this replaced — three separate
# '(^|[;&|[:space:]])printenv.*SECRET' / '...TOKEN' / '...KEY' patterns —
# matched ANY printenv invocation whose command text contained one of those
# three substrings anywhere after "printenv", with no way to distinguish a
# genuinely secret-bearing read (`printenv GITHUB_TOKEN`) from a non-secret
# pointer/identity variable that merely has one of those words in its name
# (`printenv LOOM_TOKEN_NAME` — an account-label string identifying which
# OAuth token slot is active, not a credential value; see
# docs/token-pool.md — spawn-claude.sh already logs it in plaintext).
#
# DENYLIST substring check, ALLOWLIST override (deliberate): mirroring
# systemctl_ask_reason()/ssh_cat_ask_reason() above, this segment-parses the
# command with qsplit() (quote-aware, #3755), strips a leading sudo/env
# wrapper per segment, and only inspects segments whose command word is
# literally `printenv`. Each remaining operand (the variable name being
# read) still asks if its name contains SECRET/TOKEN/KEY as a substring —
# the same narrowing the old patterns used — UNLESS the operand is an
# EXACT match for a documented non-secret var (LOOM_TOKEN_NAME,
# LOOM_TOKEN_MODE). The allowlist match is exact-string, not substring, so
# a lookalike name that merely CONTAINS an allowlisted name (e.g.
# LOOM_TOKEN_NAME_BACKUP) still asks — guards against a suffix/prefix-match
# bypass. Any unrecognized/unlisted credential-shaped name falls through to
# the safer default (ask), so a new var-naming convention is never silently
# allowed.

# CARGO CLEAN SCOPE ASK — bare `cargo clean` clearing a build.target-dir
# SHARED outside the current repo (#6684), gated by cargo_clean_guard_enabled()
#
# On a host whose `~/.cargo/config.toml` (or an ancestor `.cargo/config.toml`)
# sets a single `build.target-dir` shared across every project — e.g. an
# external volume used after the internal disk hit ENOSPC — a bare `cargo
# clean` is not a local operation: it deletes the build output of EVERY
# project on that host, including whatever sweep is compiling concurrently
# elsewhere. The failure this produces names nothing about the cause (a mid-
# build "No such file or directory" on the victim's OWN target dir), so the
# agent that gets hit has no way to tell a shared-clean collision apart from a
# faulted volume.
#
# `cargo clean -p <pkg>` (package-scoped) and a repo-local target dir are
# completely unaffected — no resolution is attempted, no prompt — so this adds
# zero friction to the common case.
#
# Detection is segment-parsed (qsplit(), #3755) and command-word anchored,
# mirroring systemctl_ask_reason()/ssh_cat_ask_reason() immediately above:
# only a segment whose actual command word is `cargo` (after stripping a
# leading sudo) with `clean` as the very next token, and no `-p`/`--package`
# flag anywhere in its remaining tokens, is a candidate. A same-command
# `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<value> cargo clean` assignment immediately preceding the
# command word is captured too (cargo's own env-override precedence).
#
# CARGO_TARGET_DIR — same-command OR the guard's own process env — is always
# treated as an explicit, deliberate scoping decision and NEVER asks, however
# it resolves: it is the exact fix this ask's own message recommends, so
# treating it as unsafe would be self-defeating. Only the CONFIG-derived
# resolution (`cargo config get build.target-dir`, falling back to a manual
# `.cargo/config.toml` walk-up from cwd to the filesystem root, then
# `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml`) is compared against the repo root — matching
# cargo's own real precedence, and the exact silent, invisible-to-the-agent
# sharing mechanism this issue is about.

# turning every tracked file into a phantom staged deletion. The working tree
# and HEAD are left untouched and NO reflog entry is written, so the corruption
# is silent and near-invisible (issue #3637 — a judge ran one against the main
# checkout during a merge simulation and emptied the live index).
#
# This is an ASK (not a deny) because it is generic git hygiene, not a Loom
# workflow rule, and an isolated form is legitimate. It is kept narrow: the
# safe, index-free path is `git merge-tree --write-tree <base> <branch>` for a
# merge preview, or `GIT_INDEX_FILE=$(mktemp) git read-tree <tree>` when a
# temporary index really is needed. Any command that carries a `GIT_INDEX_FILE=`
# assignment is treated as isolated and passes through untouched.

# `git commit-tree` is intentionally NOT guarded here — it writes a commit
# object from an existing tree and does not mutate the index.

# BACKTICK BOUNDARY (#5783): the leading class below now also admits a

# the true main-checkout root, from a worktree or not). They are EQUAL only
# when CWD is the main checkout; they diverge when CWD is a linked worktree. A
# subdirectory-prefix test would be fooled here because Loom's own linked
# worktrees live NESTED inside the main checkout's tree
# (`<main>/.loom/worktrees/issue-N`) — that path is textually "under" the main
# root even though it is a distinct working tree, so a naive prefix match would
# ask inside a builder's own worktree too. The show-toplevel/common-dir
# comparison sidesteps that entirely.
#
# CD-PREFIX THREADING (#5173): unlike the raw $CWD comparison this replaced,
# resolve_stash_cwd() (defined above, mirrors parse_force_ops' cd-tracking
# from #5156/#5161) threads a `cd <dir> &&` prefix earlier in the SAME
# compound $COMMAND through to the stash pop/drop/clear invocation, so a
# command like `cd .loom/worktrees/issue-N && git stash pop` — hook session
# cwd still the main repo root, the common shape per this repo's own
# CLAUDE.md worktree workflow — resolves scope against the cd TARGET, not the
# hook's raw session cwd. Both the main-checkout ask below AND the
# worktree-collision ask (#4821) further down consume the SAME
# _stash_toplevel/_stash_common_parent values, so both get this treatment
# for free.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION: unlike the force-op parser (parse_force_ops), this check
# does not thread a `git -C <path>` argument — `git -C <main-checkout-path>
# stash pop` run from a worktree cwd is not caught today. Track any observed
# bypass via this path as a follow-up.
#
# WORKTREE-TO-WORKTREE COLLISION (#4821): refs/stash is a single stack shared
# by EVERY linked worktree of the repo, not per-worktree — so two parallel
# Builders each in a *different* linked worktree (neither one the main
# checkout) can pop/drop each other's WIP, and the main-checkout-only check
# above asks for neither side. Observed in production: kicad-tools PRs
# #4524/#4526. Below, when cwd is a linked worktree (not the main checkout)
# AND two or more `.loom-managed` worktrees currently exist under
# `<main>/.loom/worktrees/`, we ask too — a single active worktree has no one
# else's stash entry to collide with, so it stays ungated.
#
# NOTE (#5217): this fires correctly, per the design above, for a legitimate
# `git stash push && <baseline check> && git stash pop` pattern too — used to
# diff a clean baseline against WIP (clippy/shellcheck/test-output
# comparisons) — since in this repo's typical worktree count that pattern is
# gated on nearly every occurrence, with no human to answer in headless mode.
# A same-chain heuristic ("push and pop appear in the same command, so
# allow") was considered and REJECTED during #5217's curation: push and pop
# are two separate guard-approved Bash calls with an arbitrary-duration
# command running between them, so another worktree's concurrent `git stash
# push` can still land on the SHARED stack during that window, and a same-
# chain "pop" then restores the WRONG entry — a same-chain heuristic alone
# cannot see that. The fix is `worktree.sh stash-push`/`stash-pop`
# (`.loom/scripts/worktree.sh`), which never touch `refs/stash` — WIP is
# anchored to a PER-ISSUE ref instead, so there is no shared stack left to
# collide on. This ask (and the main-checkout ask above) stay exactly as
# strict as before for any RAW `git stash pop/drop/clear` — the new commands
# are a guard-transparent replacement path, not a guard exemption.
#
# CREATE-SIDE REDIRECT (#5754): the two asks below fired 32 times in the five
# days 2026-08-04..08 (`.loom/logs/guard-decisions.log`, ~7.2/day) — all of them
# AFTER both the role-prompt guidance and the inline suggestion text in the ask
# itself had landed, so restating the same advice a third time was not going to
# help. Classifying those 32 by chain shape showed the guard was gated on the
# wrong half of the stash cycle:
#
#   - 15/32 chained a CREATE and a RECOVERY in one command (`cd <wt> && git
#     stash && <check>; git stash pop`). The create is silently allowed today,
#     so the guard only speaks up at the pop — at the END of the chain, about a
#     decision made at the START of it.
#   - 11/32 were RECOVERY-ONLY: WIP already sitting on `refs/stash` from an
#     earlier, silently-allowed create. Three consecutive entries from one
#     worktree (issue-5654, 01:46:00/13/18Z) show an agent trying to force the
#     pop through with an inline `LOOM_GUARD_STASH_SCOPE=0` prefix, which
#     cannot work — the hook is a separate process and reads its OWN
#     environment.
#   - 6/32 were guard self-tests, where `git stash pop` appears as inert text.
#
# That distribution is why the RECOVERY asks below are NOT escalated to deny.
# The hazard needs two parties: A pushes onto the shared stack, B pops. Denying
# only B protects A but strands B — `refs/stash` has no sanctioned reader other
# than `git stash pop` (worktree.sh's stash-pop reads a per-issue ref), so a
# deny there converts "ask a human" into "lose the work".
#
# Blocking the CREATE instead is lossless: the working tree is untouched, so
# the agent simply reruns with the replacement command, and no entry ever
# reaches the shared stack for anyone to collide on. So a raw stash CREATE is
# DENIED — not asked — but only where a scriptable safe equivalent provably
# exists and can be named exactly:
#
#   1. cwd resolves inside a LINKED worktree (never the main checkout —
#      main-checkout creates stay ALLOWED, exactly as today). #6076 added
#      `worktree.sh stash-push main` / `stash-pop main`, so a redirect target
#      now exists there too and the main-checkout ASK message names it; the
#      create-side DENY was deliberately NOT extended to the primary clone,
#      because that clone also hosts legitimate raw-stash producers this hook
#      cannot distinguish (check-main-clean.sh --quarantine's rescue push, an
#      operator's own interactive shelf). Widening the deny is a separate,
#      independently-evidenced change, not a side effect of adding the pair;
#   2. that worktree carries the `.loom-managed` sentinel and its directory
#      name yields an issue number, so the message can print the literal
#      `stash-push <N>` / `stash-pop <N>` pair instead of a `<issue-number>`
#      placeholder the agent has to fill in;
#   3. `<main>/.loom/scripts/worktree.sh` actually exists;
#   4. two or more `.loom-managed` worktrees are active — the SAME predicate as
#      the worktree-collision ask below, so the deny fires exactly where the
#      paired pop would have stalled, and a solo worktree stays fully ungated.
#
# Verification (falsifiable, for a later Curator/Auditor pass): re-run
# `jq -r 'select(.pattern|startswith("stash-scope"))|.ts[0:10]'
# .loom/logs/guard-decisions.log | sort | uniq -c` at least 7 days after this
# lands. `stash-scope:worktree-collision` should fall well below its 2026-08-04
# ..08 baseline of ~7.2 combined hits/day, with any residue concentrated in
# `stash-scope:create-redirect` (a deny, which does not stall) and in
# main-checkout hits (deliberately unchanged).
#
# Gated by stash_scope_guard_enabled() (guards.stashScope /
# LOOM_GUARD_STASH_SCOPE, default on), invoked LAZILY only after the pattern
# already matched, mirroring every other cold-path toggle in this file.
#
# BACKTICK / NO-SPACE-PAREN BOUNDARY (#5783): both checks below now admit a
# backtick as a leading boundary (alongside the `(` they already had), so
# `` `git stash pop` `` and `` X=`git stash pop` `` are no longer invisible
# to this scan the way `` `git clean -fd` `` was to ASK_PATTERNS above. The
# recovery-subcommand check's TRAILING boundary is also widened — it used to
# require whitespace or end-of-string right after `pop`/`drop`/`clear`, which
# missed both a no-space `$(git stash pop)` (trailing `)`) and a no-space
# `` `git stash pop` `` (trailing backtick); it now accepts either, plus the
# shell-separator set the pre-check's own trailing class already accepted.
#
# QUOTE-AWARE SCAN COPY (#7363): all three checks below scan COMMAND_STASH_SCAN
# (built above, a branch of COMMAND_ASK_SCAN with grep/egrep/fgrep/rg/awk's own
# quoted pattern/program argument masked out via mask_stash_scan_positional_args())
# rather than COMMAND_ASK_SCAN itself. A plain regex/substring scan of the raw
# command has no notion of shell quoting, so a read-only `grep -n "...git
# stash pop..." file` or `awk '/git stash pop/{...}' file` — searching for a
# literal string that merely CONTAINS a stash-recovery phrase (e.g. a
# test-case name) — was indistinguishable from a real invocation. Using the
# masked copy here (and ONLY here — never fed back into COMMAND_ASK_SCAN
# itself) narrows stash-scope's own false-positive surface without touching
# SQL_DDL_PATTERN or any other COMMAND_ASK_SCAN consumer.

# false-asked after the catastrophic scan stopped false-denying it. In a headless
# sweep an unanswered ask blocks just like a deny (see defaults/docs/
# guard-hooks.md), so leaving it here would have left the reported stall half
# fixed for the aws siblings. A real `aws s3 rb s3://bucket` outside a quoted
# flag value is untouched and still asks.

# SCANS COMMAND_CLOUD_ASK_SCAN (#6002), NOT COMMAND_ASK_SCAN directly -- see
# that variable's own definition above for why it carries additional
# for-loop-word-list / grep-rg-jq-positional masking that COMMAND_ASK_SCAN
# itself deliberately does not (SQL_DDL_PATTERN's competing need to still see
# that same text). COMMAND_CLOUD_ASK_SCAN is a strict superset-redaction of
# COMMAND_ASK_SCAN (every byte COMMAND_ASK_SCAN already masks stays masked
# here too), so this substitution only narrows what CLOUD_ASK_PATTERNS can
# match -- it can never widen it.

# redirect, and the 'pip install -e' worktree block keyed on LOOM_WORKTREE_PATH)
# were extracted into guard-loom-workflow.sh (issue #3604). They are registered
# as a separate PreToolUse/Bash hook and fire independently of this guard. This
# file is the generic repository-hygiene guard, on its way to Repo Skills
# (rjwalters/repo#13); the Loom-specific pair stays Loom-owned.
