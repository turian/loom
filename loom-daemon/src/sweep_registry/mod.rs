//! Sweep registry — in-memory tracking of dispatched `/loom:sweep` children
//! (Issue #3452, Phase A of epic #3449).
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This module implements the daemon-side surface for dispatching and
//! tracking `/loom:sweep` runs. It is the foundation for the v0.10.0 daemon
//! rebuild — Phase A delivers:
//!
//! - A `Sweep` resource type (see [`crate::types::SweepInfo`]).
//! - In-memory `BTreeMap<SweepId, SweepInfo>` storage.
//! - `dispatch_sweep` primitive that shells out to
//!   `defaults/scripts/spawn-claude.sh` (NOT a Rust re-implementation of
//!   token rotation) and detaches a `claude -p "/loom:sweep N"` child.
//! - `list_sweeps` query with optional state filtering.
//! - Atomic `mkdir`-based claim locks under `.loom/locks/issue-<N>/`,
//!   matching the spawn-loop primitive at
//!   `defaults/scripts/spawn-loop.sh:293-309`.
//! - A reaper task that polls live PIDs on a 30s interval (env-overridable
//!   via `LOOM_SWEEP_REAPER_INTERVAL_SECS`, matching the spawn-loop
//!   `POLL_INTERVAL` default at `spawn-loop.sh:110`).
//! - Registry reconstruction on startup from live processes + checkpoints.
//!
//! # Idempotency
//!
//! When `idempotency_key` is provided and a `Running` sweep already holds
//! it, dispatch returns the existing `sweep_id` with no new spawn. Exited
//! or crashed entries with a matching key do NOT block re-dispatch — the
//! dedup window is the lifetime of the *running* entry.
//!
//! # Forge as source of truth
//!
//! Per the parent epic, the daemon does NOT persist sweep state to disk.
//! Recovery on restart relies on:
//!
//! - Live process detection (`kill(pid, 0)`).
//! - Sweep checkpoints under `.loom/sweep-checkpoint/issue-<N>.json` (#3373),
//!   but **only for daemon-owned sweeps**: `.loom/sweep-checkpoint/` is shared
//!   with the in-session `/loom:sweep` path, so a checkpoint is recovered only
//!   when a daemon-owned lock (`.loom/locks/issue-<N>/`, written exclusively by
//!   `dispatch`) also existed for that issue. This keeps the daemon from
//!   ingesting phantom entries for in-session sweeps it never dispatched
//!   (#3808). See [`SweepRegistry::reconstruct`].
//! - Forge labels (`loom:issue` vs `loom:building`).
//!
//! One exception (Issue #3953): `dispatch` also writes a minimal
//! `{repo, issue, pid, started_at}` liveness record to the machine-level
//! [`crate::sweep_journal`] (`~/.loom/sweeps.json`). This is NOT sweep state
//! in the sense above — it carries no phase/status/log-path information, only
//! what `loom-recover-orphans` needs to tell a live claim from a dead one
//! after a daemon restart wipes this in-memory registry. See
//! [`crate::claim_reconciliation`] for the startup consumer.
//!
//! # Module layout (#4711)
//!
//! This directory replaces the former 19k-line `sweep_registry.rs` monolith.
//! `mod.rs` keeps the `SweepRegistry`/`SweepRegistryConfig` struct
//! definitions, small config accessors, and the shared cross-cutting types
//! (`DispatchOutcome`, `StartupRaceConfig`, …); everything else is grouped by
//! concern into a sibling file, each contributing its own
//! `impl SweepRegistry { .. }` block(s): [`model`] (dispatch model/alias
//! resolution), [`crash_signals`] (child-log parsing and crash
//! classification), [`dispatch`] (the dispatch call path + backoff),
//! [`locks`] (claim-lock lifecycle + startup reconstruction),
//! [`outcome_journal`] (the `sweep.outcome` telemetry journal),
//! [`guards`] (pre-dispatch collision/label guards), [`quarantine`]
//! (insta-crash tallying + quarantine lifecycle), [`stacking`]
//! (`depends_on` bookkeeping), [`reaper`] (`reap_once`/cancel/resume), and
//! [`watchdog`] (the hung-sweep/midbuild/review-stall watchdogs). All public
//! call paths (`crate::sweep_registry::*`) are unchanged. [`noop_cooldown`]
//! (no-op re-dispatch cooldown, Issue #6670) is a sibling of [`quarantine`]
//! and the dispatch backoff in [`dispatch`], but call-through only — it is
//! never inferred from `reap_once`'s own terminal-outcome classification.
//! [`decline_cooldown`] (hard-exclusion decline cooldown, Issue #7528) is a
//! fourth sibling of the same family and, unlike `noop_cooldown`, IS inferred
//! by `reap_once` — from a fact on the forge (the issue carries a
//! [`crate::hard_exclusion`] label) rather than from a crash classification.
